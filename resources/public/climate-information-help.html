	<h3>Projected Climatic Data</h3>
	
	<p>Climate projection data employed includes those produced by McGrath et al. (2008), Sweeney et al. (2008) and Nolan et al. (2012a; 2012b)</p>
	
	<b>Maps</b>
	
	<p>The map to the left shows climate model projections for selected climate variables relative to the baseline period (1961-1990)</p>
	<p>Users can choose to display projected changes for a variety of climatic variables, at a variety of temporal and spatial scales.</p>
	<p>Climate projection data can be selected by the user according to season - Summer (June, July, August), Autumn (September, October, November), Winter (December, January, February), Spring (March, April, May) -  or on an annual basis.</p>
	<p>There are 5 emissions scenarios to choose from: A2, high emissions; A1B, fairly high emissions; ensemble, a multi-model unweighted average value calculated from all projections and emissions scenarios.</p>

	<b>Graphs</b>
	
	<p>Using the map tool, users can select an area of interest and further examine the projected climatic information for this area using the graph on the right</p>
	<p>For the selected variable, season and area of interest, the boxplot to the right shows the range of values projected for each decade calculated for all available scenarios.</p>
	<p>For each decade, the mean of all projections is shown, as well as the maximum and minimum values.</p>
	<p>The thick bar represents the range over which half all of the projected values lie.</li>
