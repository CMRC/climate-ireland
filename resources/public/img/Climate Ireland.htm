	</i></i><h3><i><i>Introduction</i></i></h3><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Uncertainty describes the quality of our knowledge of 
risk.  Risk is commonly defined as the product of the probability or 
likelihood of occurrence of a hazard and the magnitude of consequence.  
As a result, uncertainty may relate to either the probability or 
consequence components of risk <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>All decisions made are intended to bring some future 
benefit to something or someone and without uncertainty, these decisions
 would be straightforward.  However, in reality, making decisions is far
 more complex and generally involves judgements regarding uncertainty.  
In order to overcome uncertainties and make well informed decisions, it 
is important to: (1) identify the sources of uncertainty, (2) understand
 how these uncertainties contribute to the decision uncertainty, and (3)
 manage the uncertainty in the decision making process. <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Similar to any other decision context, making 
adaptation decisions is complex and requires knowledge of future 
climatic changes.  In addition, because adaptation problems do not occur
 in isolation, difficulties in projecting non-climatic factors such as 
social, demographic, political and economic change is also problematic. 
 Moreover, in adaptation planning, the end point is not only determined 
by what is known or anticipated at present but also by what will be 
experienced and learned as the future unfolds and by policy responses<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</i></i></p><i><i>   
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Adaptation decision-making does not require precise 
foresight of future change and uncertainties do not prevent anticipatory
 adaptation.  A number of approaches are available to enable decision 
makers to manage uncertainty and they can be employed at a variety 
spatial scales, from individual decisions to sector-based and national 
adaptation planning.  In contrast to approaches which seek to develop an
 optimal plan that may achieve the best results among all possible plans
 but carries no guarantee beyond a narrowly defined set of 
circumstances, planning for climate change requires plans based on 
robustness and flexibility.</i></i></p><i><i>   
	
	</i></i><ul class="small-indent">
	<li><i><i>Robust decision making uses multiple views of the future to 
support a thorough evaluation of the full range of potential future 
vulnerabilities and opportunities.  On this basis, a plan is developed 
that is robust across a broad range of possible futures but may not 
necessarily perform optimally in any single future.  Robust decision 
making aims to avoid situations in which the plan would fail to meet 
it's goals and clearly identifies the remaining vulnerabilities under 
which the plan would fail to meet its goals<span class="reference"><a href="#?">[walker]</a></span>.
  For example, instead of planning for a dam that will have a 100 year 
lifespan and will full fill its purpose under a set of prescribed set of
 conditions, a robust strategy identifies the full range of possible 
futures and then seeks strategies that will perform well over a wide 
range of alternative futures.</i></i></li>  
	
	<li><i><i>Flexible approaches to adaptation comprise those where 
decisions are made overtime to continuously adapt while maintaining 
flexibility about future options.  Moreover, flexible approaches 
encourage robust planning practises that avoid lock-in that happens when
 policy is placed on an unchanging pathway as the result of a once off 
adaptation decision that cannot be revisited <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</i></i></li>
	</ul><i><i>
	
	</i></i><h4><i><i>Adaptive Management</i></i></h4><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Adaptive Management is a term which describes the ability to change plans based on new experience or information <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.
  Adaptive management calls for managers to take an ecosystem-level view
 of the resource that they manage and provides a structured approach for
 developing dynamic and robust adaptation plans to support the 
implementation of long term plans despite the presence of uncertainties.
  It sets out a process of continuing phases of assessment, design, 
implementation and adjustment.  The process is often described as 
'learning by doing'.</i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Adaptive management occurs in two phases:</i></i></p><i><i>
	</i></i><ol>
	<li><i><i>the design phase, in which a dynamic adaptive plan, monitoring programme and pre- and post-implementation actions are designed;</i></i></li>
	<li><i><i>Once the basic plan is established, the plan is implemented 
and monitoring commences.  The process is not linear as monitoring is 
continuous and may lead to different actions at various points in time.</i></i></li>
	
	
	</ol><p><i><i>In developing an adaptive management plan, decision makers follow a number of steps:</i></i></p><i><i> 
	
	</i></i><ul>
	<li><i><i>The  existing condition of the area/resource under consideration is first assessed and objectives of the plan are specified;</i></i></li>
	<li><i><i>The means by which the objectives are to be achieved are then developed and a basic plan is assembled;</i></i></li>  
	<li><i><i>Once assembled, the basic plan is assessed in terms of 
meeting its objectives across the range of plausible futures.  The plan 
is then made more robust (performs well across the range of plausible 
futures) through four types of actions: shaping actions (actions to 
reduce failure or enhance success), mitigating actions (actions to 
reduce the likely adverse effects of a plan), hedging actions (actions 
to taken to spread or reduce the uncertain adverse affects of the plan) 
and seizing actions (actions to seize any likely opportunities);</i></i></li>
	<li><i><i>Mechanisms to monitor the plan over time are then identified.
  This called contingency planning.  Signposts specify information that 
should be tracked in order to determine if the plan is meeting its 
objectives.  Critical values of signposts (triggers) beyond which 
additional actions should be taken are identified.</i></i></li>  
	
	</ul><p><i><i>The adaptive management plan is then implemented and 
monitored over time.  The plan is evaluated based on the status of the 
resource under consideration, indicated by signposts, and adjusted to 
reflect both lessons learned in the management process and also the 
development of new information.  Inherent in this design is a need for 
continuous data gathering and a commitment to following the process.</i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><h4><i><i>Adaptation Pathways and Adaptation Tipping Points</i></i></h4><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>In developing an adaptation plan, there is a need to 
consider timing of actions and to and take a more flexible approach 
where decisions are taken overtime while at the same time maintaining 
flexibility about future options.</i></i></p><i><i>

	</i></i><p><i><i>This flexibility can be achieved by sequencing the 
implementation of different measures over time so that options are 
available to deal with a range of possible futures.  For example, 
low-regret options are taken earlier and more inflexible measures, e.g. 
grey options, are delayed in anticipation of better information <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.
  Moreover, this approach aims to ensure that whatever measures are 
taken in the short to medium term are set within a framework that will 
not be maladaptive should climate change progress in a way that is not 
yet anticipated as being the most probable.</i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Central to adaptation pathways are Adaptation Tipping 
Points (ATPs), which are the conditions under which an action no longer 
meets its objective and after reaching a tipping point, additional 
actions are needed.  The adaptation pathways approach presents a 
sequence of possible actions after a tipping point forming an adaptation
 tree <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span></i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>On this basis, decision makers need to design dynamic 
adaptive plans that contain a strategic vision of the future, commit to 
short and medium term actions, and establish a plan to guide future 
actions, meet changing circumstances and ensure resilience in the long 
term.  With the adaptation map, decision makers can identify 
opportunities, low regret measures, lock-ins and the timing of actions 
in order to support decision making in a changing environment <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>. </i></i></p><i><i>
	
	</i></i><h4><i><i>Dynamic Adaptation Pathways</i></i></h4><i><i>
	
	</i></i><p><i><i>Both the adaptation management and adaptation pathways
 approaches aim at supporting decision-making in the long term and in 
the face of uncertainty and emphasise the need for adaptability of 
plans.  More specifically, both approaches offer support in choosing 
near term actions while keeping open the possibility to modify extend or
 otherwise alter the plan in response to how the future unfolds.  The 
combination of Adaptive Management and Adaptation Pathways is termed 
'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'.  This approach includes transient 
scenarios representing a variety of uncertainties and their development 
overtime different types of actions to hand vulnerabilities and 
opportunities; the sequencing of adaptation actions; and a monitoring 
system with related contingency actions to keep the plan on track to a 
preferred pathway <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.</i></i></p><i><i> 
	
	</i></i><ol>
	<li><i><i>The first step involves describing the system, objectives 
constraints in the current and possible future situations.  In addition,
 a description of the uncertainties involved in the decision making 
process should be identified and are not restricted to uncertainties 
about the future but also about data or models that are being used;</i></i></li>  
	<li><i><i>The second step involves the development of future scenarios 
based on the uncertainties identified in the first step.  A comparison 
of the current situation and possible future situations can they be made
 and any vulnerabilities or opportunities that may arise are identified.
  This determines if and when actions are needed;</i></i></li>  
	<li><i><i>To assemble a rich set of actions, these can be classified as
 shaping actions (actions to reduce failure or enhance success), 
mitigating actions (actions to reduce the likely adverse effects of a 
plan), hedging actions (actions to taken to spread or reduce the 
uncertain adverse affects of the plan) and seizing actions (actions to 
seize any likely opportunities).  These actions are then used to 
assemble adaptation pathways and the performance of each adaptation 
pathway is assessed in the light of the defined objectives to determine 
its adaptation tipping point.</i></i></li>  
	<li><i><i>Once a set of actions seem adequate, potential pathways can 
be constructed and one or more pathways can then be selected as input 
for a dynamic robust adaptation plan.  The aim of the plan is to keep 
the preferred pathway open as long as possible.  For this purpose, 
contingency actions are specified and a trigger for each contingency is 
specified and monitored <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</i></i></li>
