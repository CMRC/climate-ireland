    <h3>What is Climate Change?
    <p>&nbsp;</p>Climate refers to global or regional weather patterns experienced over long time periods, typically 30 years.  Throughout the earth's history, natural and human factors have affected global climate.  Examples of natural changes in climate include changes in the earth's orbit and volcanic eruptions while humans influence global climate through the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.   Over the last 100 years, climate is changing and in its fourth assessment report, the IPCC conclude that there is 90% probability that the global warming of the last 50 years is due to man-made green house gases.  Global warming is now taking place  at a much faster rate than previously expected and poses significant and imminent threat to Ireland.  Similar to global patterns of climate change, the last century has been a period of rapid climate change for Ireland.  There has been an increase in average annual temperature of 0.5˚C during the 20th century with a more rapid rate of increase evident since the 1980s while patterns of precipitation have also changed,  increased levels of precipitation are now evident in the north and west of the country while decreases or smaller increases in levels of precipitation are recorded in the south and east.  These observed changes have had already had impacts on many parts of society and  it is expected that over the coming century, these changes will continue and intensify.
