        <p><a class="Glossary" id="climate">Climate</a> refers to global or
          regional weather patterns experienced over long time periods,
          typically 30 years. Throughout the earth's history, natural and human
          factors have affected global climate. Examples of natural changes in
          climate include changes in the earth's orbit and volcanic eruptions
          while humans influence global climate through the release of
          greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Over
          the last 100 years, climate is changing and in its fourth assessment
          report, the IPCC conclude that there is 90% probability that the
          global warming of the last 50 years is due to man-made green house
          gases. Global warming is now taking place at a much faster rate than
          previously expected and poses significant and imminent threat to
          Ireland. Similar to global patterns of climate change, the last
          century has been a period of rapid climate change for Ireland. There
          has been an increase in average annual temperature of 0.5°C during the
          20th century with a more rapid rate of increase evident since the
          1980s while patterns of precipitation have also changed, increased
          levels of precipitation are now evident in the north and west of the
          country while decreases or smaller increases in levels of
          precipitation are recorded in the south and east. These observed
          changes have had already had impacts on many parts of society and it
          is expected that over the coming century, these changes will continue
          and intensify.</p>

        <p>The global climate is changing and this is particularly the case
          since the onset of the industrial period and its associated rapid
          increase in levels of emission of greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 in
          particular. From 1906-2005, average global temperature has increased
          by 0.74°C and similar to the global picture, for Ireland, measurements
          indicates an increase in average temperature of 0.5°C during the 20th
          century and the rate of increase has become more rapid since the
          1980s. This increase in temperatures is reflected by the fact that, in
          the northern hemisphere, the 1990s was the hottest decade of what has
          been the hottest century for a millennia. Globally, an increase in
          temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change patterns of
          precipitation. Other likely effects of increasing temperatures include
          the more frequent occurrence of extreme events such as droughts, heat
          waves, heavy rainfall events, species extinction and change in
          agricultural yields. The rate of warming and the related changes will
          vary from region to region. However, the exact nature of these
          regional changes remains uncertain. </p>

        <p>Climate change poses a significant and imminent threat to Ireland.
          Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it affects all
          aspects of life as we know it and its effects will be felt across all
          sectors. In the coming century, we can expect, amongst others: higher
          sea levels, more storms and more intense storms, warmer temperatures
          and warmer waters, more flooding, summer droughts and changing
          rainfall patterns. These changes will put Ireland at risk, both
          directly and indirectly. For example, storms and violent winds could
          affect critical infrastructure, summer droughts could put a strain on
          water supplies, floods could submerge homes and businesses, rising sea
          levels and increased storm surges could threaten all of Ireland's
          cities. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Climate Modelling</h3>
        <p>The climate system can be represented by computer models which
          comprise a range of mathematical equations. These computer models
          allow us to predict how the climate might change in the future. Recent
          developments in climate modelling, in addition to improved computing
          power, allow us to have greater confidence in our predictions.
          However, developing climate models is a complex procedure and climate
          models cannot fully represent the complexity of our climate system. As
          a result, there is still considerable uncertainty associated with
          predicted climate information. Due to the complexities of developing
          climate models, there are only a few places in the world that carry
          out climate modelling. In order to create a global climate model
          (GCM), the globe is divided into grid blocks or cell. These grid
          blocks will normally have a coarse resolution, covering 3-4 degrees
          across the globe. The model is then run and predictions are computed
          for each grid block on the globe. Using a variety of complex
          mathematical procedures, these global projections can be down-scaled
          using a regional climate model (RCM) which will provide predictions
          for smaller areas of land or sea. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Adaptation and Mitigation</h3>
        <p>Climate change is happening and even if levels of greenhouse gas
          emissions decrease rapidly, there will still be some inevitable
          effects of climate change. This is due to our history of greenhouse
          gas emission, the persistence of these gases in the atmosphere and the
          slow warming of the oceans. The slow response of the oceans mean that
          temperatures and sea level will continue to rise for several decades
          regardless of our efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Our
          efforts to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas emission in order to
          prevent the worst effects of climate change are known as mitigating
          actions. However, in order to protect from the now inevitable
          consequences of climate change, adaptation actions are essential. The
          IPCC defines adaptation as: "adjustments in natural or human systems
          in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects,
          which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities". In order to
          adjust to and to take advantage of the consequences of climate change,
          it is essential that we build our capacity to adapt (adaptive
          capacity).</p>

        <p>International scientific evidence has shown that human activities
          have begun to modify global climate and that these changes will have
          significant social and economic implications. The Fourth Assessment
          Report of the IPCC (2007) details projections from a range of global
          climate models and indicate that significant impacts on world climate
          are likely to occur over the present century. The projected increase
          in global temperatures are unlikely to be uniformly distributed with
          increased rates of warming, nearly double the global average,
          projected to occur at higher latitudes. This projected regional
          variation in global warming will also affect the distribution and rate
          of change in other meteorological variables. â€¢ Global temperatures
          are projected to increase by between 1.8°C to 4.0°C by 2080 - 2099 â€¢
          An increase in the occurrence of hot extremes, heat waves and heavy
          precipitation events is likely to occur â€¢ An increase in levels of
          precipitation is projected for the mid to high latitudes with
          reductions projected for the low latitudes. â€¢ A widespread decrease
          in mountain glaciers is expected while snow cover is also projected to
          contract and the upper layers of permafrost are projected to melt â€¢
          Antarctica is to gain mass due to enhanced snowfall. In contrast,
          Greenland is likely to lose mass due a greater relative increase in
          runoff. The extent of summer sea ice cover in the Arctic and
          Antarctica is projected to decrease and, according to some model
          predictions, summer sea ice in the Arctic is expected to disappear
          towards the end of this century. â€¢ Globally, sea level is expected
          to rise by between 0.28 m and 0.43 m by the end of the century â€¢
          Storm track locations are projected to shift polewards while the
          number of tropical cyclones per year is likely to decrease. However,
          the intensity of these storms is expected to increase. â€¢ The
          Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), of which the Gulf
          Stream is a part, is estimated to reduce by 25% during the present
          century. However, an abrupt transition during this period is unlikely.</p>

        <h3>Sea surface temperature</h3>
        <p>Water has a higher capacity than air to uptake and retain heat and as
          a result the oceans uptake 20 times more heat than the atmosphere. In
          general, changes in sea temperature follow those of global air
          temperature and over the period 1961-2003 the average global
          temperature of the oceans has risen by 0.10Â°C down to a depth of
          700m. According to the IPCC, this warming is to continue and by the
          end of the 21st century global ocean temperatures will have increased
          by an average of 2-3°C. Importantly, this warming results in the
          thermal expansion of sea waters which in combination with the related
          melting of the ice caps is seen as the primary cause of global sea
          level rise. Changes in sea surface temperature may also significantly
          influence the global circulation of water masses and currents which
          are driven by differences in the relative densities of warm,and cold,
          saline and fresh waters (also known as thermohaline circulation). Sea
          temperature also has an impact on atmospheric processes and can result
          in the increasing intensity and frequency of cyclones which bring
          severe winds and storms. Warming sea water also has an influence on
          ecosystems, the pole-ward migration of species, mortality, coral
          bleaching and increased algae blooms.</p>

        <h3>Sea Level Rise</h3>
        <p>Over the last century sea level has risen globally by 1-2 mm/yr, at a
          far greater rate than was observed for the 19th century. It is
          predicted that in the 21st century this process will continue and at a
          faster rate with projections suggesting a rise in global sea levels in
          the range of 9 - 88 mm by 2100. The melting of ice cover in a warmer
          climate, in combination with the thermal expansion of seawater due to
          higher water temperature, is seen as the most important factor in
          causing sea level rise. However, the actual increase in sea level will
          vary significantly for different locations as well as the potential
          damage it may cause. Natural elevation of certain areas due to global
          geological processes may compensate for rising sea level. Nonetheless,
          highly populated estuarine areas with developed economies and
          infrastructure are facing the biggest risk.</p>
        <p>Rising sea level are associated with the physical loss of lands (or

          erosion, changing exploitation conditions for marine and coastal

        <p>Warming air temperature, global water and air circulation affect the
          chemical and physical characteristics of sea water. Observations show
          that water in the lower tropical and sub-tropical latitudes becomes
          more saline as the result of higher temperatures and rates of
          evaporation. At the same time waters at higher sub-polar latitudes
          become fresher due to surface run-off, more intense precipitation and
          the melting of ice covers. In general, Pacific waters become less
          saline while Atlantic and Indian oceans show increases in levels of
          salinity. Such shifts may affect ecosystem balance through changes in

        <h3>Ocean Acidification</h3>
        <p>As a result of increased anthropogenic emissions of CO2, an increased
          amount of atmospheric CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans, a process
          termed "ocean acidification", which alters the content of inorganic
          carbon in sea water and results in a decrease in levels pH. Fossil
          fuel combustion, agricultural activity and surface water run off also
          contribute to increased levels of acidity. The impact of these factors
          is small at the global level but on a local scale, where acidic inputs
          are concentrated, the effects may be notable. Observed changes in
          average global levels of pH for sea water show a decrease from 8.2 to
          8.1 which represent a 30% increase in levels of acidity. Observations
          show that the lowest rate of increase in acidity (decreased pH) has
          occurred in the low latitudes while the highest levels of
          acidification are apparent in the high latitudes which can be linked
          to higher buffering capacities of the tropical waters. The IPCC
          "business as usual" scenario suggests a further increase in acidity by
          up to 120% by 2100 which would result in conditions that have not been
          present on Earth for millions of years. Due to the lack of historical
          observation for changes of such a scale, the full range of impacts
          continued ocean acidification might result in are difficult to
          predict. However, ocean acidification has been predicted to result in
          substantial ecosystem changes, in particular the ability of organisms
          to produce calcium necessary for shells and skeletons, resulting in
          coral bleaching, and the migration or extinction of some forms of sea
          life which form the basis of all marine food webs - effects that have
          already been witnessed in some areas. Ocean acidification is therefore
          one of the key long-term threats for the fishing industry, with
          knock-on effects for the livelihoods of coastal communities.</p>

        <h3>Coastal Erosion</h3>
        <p>Rising Sea Level may cause the physical loss of land along the shore
          and affects the distribution of sediments and rocky materials between
          the land and near-shore (littoral) zone. More severe storminess and
          wave height makes these redistributive processes more rapid and
          intense, potentially causing coastal erosion. However, the intensity
          and speed of the erosion depends on a range of local characteristics,
          such as the type of sediments (soft sand or solid rocks), the shape of
          the coast, and the local wave and wind regime which form the
          conditions for transfer and deposit of eroded materials. Some of these
          factors may be unknown, hardly predictable or require long-term
          monitoring, resulting in difficulties in deciding upon an appropriate
          management response. Moreover, a gradual increase in impacts may cause
          an abrupt change if a critical threshold is crossed, triggering the
          geomorphologic system to shift out of a relatively settled state and
          into one of rapid change. This period of change may persist until a
          new 'semi-equilibrium' coastal form can be reached that is in step
          with the new environmental regime. Although coastal erosion is a
          natural adaptation process, it can have crucial consequences for
          human-made environments along the shore, including settlements and
          infrastructure, and may cause damage to densely populated economically
          active coasts around the globe.</p>

          walls and infrastructure situated along the coast provide a barrier to
          landward ecosystem migration. As a result, habitats become "trapped"
          between the rising sea and unmoving constructions, causing a drastic
          reduction of space for salt marshes, dunes and other ecologically
          critical natural habitats. This process - known as "coastal squeeze" -
          significantly affects human activities as a result of the loss of
          lands and habitats, including reduced areas for recreational use and
          natural buffers against the impacts of storms and floods. Although it
          is difficult to attribute coastal erosion and coastal squeeze
          specifically to climate change, it is highly likely that sea level
          rise and the increasing intensity of storms may significantly
          accelerate rates of coastal erosion. In turn, an increase in the
          construction of hard defences aiming to protect the land from
          immediate effects of sea level rise and erosion may amplify coastal
          squeeze.</p>

        <h3>Storminess and Wave Height</h3>
        <p>Sea level rise and changes in the atmosphere are likely to create
          conditions for more severe storminess and wave height at the Worldâ€™s
          coasts. Rising sea levels serve to amplify the effects of storms and
          wind driven waves when reaching landfall. Changes in air and sea
          temperature impact the distribution of air pressure, regulating the
          direction and strength of winds. Several studies link the recent
          increased activity of tropical cyclones with climate change. Likewise,
          in the northern Atlantic, recent observed changes in the North
          Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) â€“ an atmospheric condition heavily
          impacting weather patterns and spatial distribution of cyclones at the
          European and North American coasts â€“ may be linked to the impacts of
          climate change.</p>
        <p>Increased storminess and wave height can lead to accelerated erosion
          and increase the risk of damage to coastal infrastructure and
          ecosystems. Regions facing increased storminess might nevertheless
          benefit from opportunities to exploit wave and wind energy resources
          if the appropriate technologies and infrastructures can be
          successfully developed and implemented.</p>

        <h3>Floods and Extreme Events</h3>
        <p>In future, extreme climate events may become more prevalent and
          severe. Moreover, their geographical distribution may change,
          endangering areas where such extreme conditions were previously rare
          or even unheard of. If such areas are densely populated or home to
          important infrastructure, unexpected extreme events can result in
          significant losses to life, property and habitats.</p>
        <p>Typhoons, storms, flooding, severe weather conditions and other
          extreme events result from a combination of factors including coastal
          geomorphology, local and global atmospheric conditions and long-term
          weather patterns. Climate change may affect these conditions in
          various, complex and often unpredictable ways. Usually extreme
          conditions result from the combination of several effects, for example
          severe winds, heavy precipitation and low air pressure can result in
          extreme coastal inundation due to the effects of storm surge and
          terrestrial surface flooding. Sea level rise brings higher tides and
          wave height causing additional increase of water level. Thus, climate
          change are likely to result in more severe, more often and less
          predictable floods.</p>

        <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Complex ocean and coastal ecosystem are highly sensitive to various impact of climate change including sea water characteristics (sea temperature, salinity, acidity), coastal geomorphology and environment (sea level rise, erosion, coastal squeeze), physical impacts (intensity of storms and waves, currents, migration of water masses) and others. Moreover, adaptation processes in human and natural systems (change in land use and land availability, invasion of new species) may cause significant change in native ecosystems. In some cases this process will lead to gradual natural adaptation to new conditions, in others may trigger dramatic changes effecting both environment and economy.

Increase in the amount of CO2 absorbed by sea water will likely lead to higher rates of photosynthesis increasing productivity of aquatic vegetation. This may cause range of impacts from positive (increased nutrient base for upper organisms) to negative (spreading coastal vegetation, water pollution). Higher level of acidity associated with CO2 may also affect calcifying organisms such as molluscs and corals. Corals are also affected by increasing storms and tropical cyclones which may cause massive damage of the reefs. Together with other human impacts, such as overfishing and water pollution, climate change represents significant risk for coral reefs ecosystems.

Distribution, reproduction and migration of marine organisms may be affected in a complex way. Alongside with possible shift of the ecosystems northward, impacts of climate change may affect food chains at different levels which may have hardly predictable results on human activities such as fisheries. Coastal and estuarine shallow water ecosystems are likely to be more vulnerable to changes. Except of marine organisms, terrestrial species may be affected as well. For example, overwintering of migratory birds on the British coast has been observed as the response to temperature rise.

        <h3 class="link">Impacts on Irish Coasts</h3>
        <p> Due to its location in the North-East Atlantic, Ireland has a
          predominantly maritime climate influenced by the migratory path of
          Atlantic cyclones which bring high wave energy and frequent severe
          storms. This is particularly the case for Irelandâ€™s western and
          northern coasts. These geographical characteristics are central to the
          role climate change will play in the evolution of Irish coastal
          systems, and will determine the magnitude of climate change impacts on
          the Irish coast. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Sea Level Rise</h3>
        <p> Projections: Satellite monitoring of Irish waters indicate an
          acceleration of sea level rise since 1990. The average long-term
          observed SLR for Ireland (about 1 cm per decade) is currently
          increasing. Sea levels around Ireland have risen about3.5 cm, over the
          past decade, with some degree of local variation in different regions.
          The IPCC projects a further global rise of sea level in the range of
          18 to 59cm which can be also applied to Irish waters. However several
          scientists consider a much higher rise of up to 1.4m to be plausible
          by the end of the century. Such projections are extremely difficult to
          make with any certainty, as critical components in them such as the
          full mechanisms behind the melting and breakup of the worldâ€™s great
          ice-sheets is relatively poorly understood. A sudden and catastrophic
          breakup of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheet would result in
          sea level rise in the order of metres rather than centimetres.</p>
        <p>Risks: The direct effects of rising sea level can an increased risk
          of the physical loss of land, coastal inundation and resulting damages
          to infrastructure situated along the coast. Though the overall risk of
          physical loss of land in Ireland is relatively low, related effects
          may cause significant damage. A sea level rise of 1 m by 2100 will
          endanger 30% of Irelandâ€™s coastal wetlands to the effects of coastal
          squeeze. Loss of wetlands reduces habitats, facilities for recreation,
          and the natural capacity of the coastal system to buffer storms,
          flooding and erosion. Coastal defences may protect in-land areas.
          However in the longer term engineered structures (sea walls, gabions)
          may amplify the effects of coastal squeeze and incur significant
          on-going maintenance costs.</p>
        <p>Winter flooding caused by a combination of factors including sea
          level rise will become more severe, particularly affecting the major
          population centres located on the Shannon estuary in the west of
          Ireland (Limerick and Galway). Areas of the south and east are also
          expected to suffer greater winter flood risk.</p>
        <p>Rising sea level may result in the intrusion of saline water into
          fresh water ecosystems and affect the quality of ground waters. With
          falling summer precipitation predicted for many catchments in Ireland,
          groundwater supply may become increasingly important for the health of
          riverine ecosystems. At present Ireland does not rely heavily on
          ground waters for fresh water supply, however in a warmer future
          climate with decreased summer precipitation ground waters may become
          important resource and their salinisation may be problematic.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: Rising sea level may also bring additional
          opportunities for ports and harbours; however strategic planning and
          investments are needed to harness these opportunities for benefit of
          economy. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Sea Surface Temperature</h3>
        <p> Projections: Projected sea surface temperature for Ireland mirrors
          the general warming trend of the land. Since the 1980s observations
          show an increase in sea surface temperature of about 0.3â€“0.4Â°C per
          decade at the Irish Atlantic edge and an even more rapid warming rate
          of 0.6â€“0.7Â°C per decade for the Irish Sea. For the Irish Sea
          region, a predicted increase of about 3Â°C by 2080 would be equivalent
          to conditions now typical for August-September (sea surface
          temperature about 16Â°C) being extended by three months more. It is
          predicted that these trends will continue causing impacts on Irish
          coastal ecosystems and economy.</p>
        <p>Risks: The impact of warming sea surface for Irish coastal waters is
          likely to be profound. Warmer waters increase the intensity and
          frequency of cyclones which will result in more extreme storm
          activity, potentially bringing the devastation of high winds and storm
          surges to the coast of Ireland. Where such storms do make landfall,
          they can cause flooding and erosion, affect maritime transport,
          commercial fisheries and energy enterprises at sea and land.</p>
        <p>The warming of Irish waters and related alterations in their acidity,
          salinity and sediment load will affect the distribution and abundance
          of biological species, including those of commercial importance to
          Irish fisheries. An observed northward shift of planktonic species of
          the North Atlantic signals a similar forthcoming migration of the
          areas other biological communities. A new spatial distribution and
          changing abundance of marine species and their food sources may carry
          significant impacts for Irish commercial fisheries. Inshore waters
          serve as nurseries for many pelagic fish species, provide
          traditionally harvested shellfish, and more recently, have played host
          to commercial aquaculture. Projected seasonal changes in precipitation
          (and subsequent river discharge) could interfere with these activities
          through, for example, altering near shore sediment distribution,
          diminishing the carrying capacity for calcifying zooplankton due to
          more acidic fresh waters. Alterations in the abundance and
          distribution of cod, herring, mackerel, hake or pollock could affect
          fisheries-dependent communities such as Ballycotton, Castletownbere,
          Killybegs and Dunmore East.</p>
        <p>Warmer waters also support lower levels of dissolved oxygen, and
          provide a more favourable environment for the growth of algal blooms,
          exacerbating the impacts of terrestrial nutrient run-off in fostering
          eutrophic conditions. These conditions will likely cause an increase
          in the growth of populations of jellyfish, potentially leading to
          losses in coastal aquaculture, the closure of beaches to bathing and
          some other forms of marine recreation.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: New fish and sea life species will likely move from
          the southerly latitudes following warmer waters. This may bring new
          commercial opportunities, however adaptation measures will be needed
          including the re-orientation of fisheries and local markets and
          consumers to new species. Warming waters may also bring additional
          opportunities for recreation, however capacities need to be built
          including tourist infrastructure, marketing and education campaigns.
          For example, the recreational impacts of a growing jelly fish
          population can be minimised if bathers are able to distinguish
          dangerous species from harmless, and timely information is provided
          about migration and current location of jelly fish blooms. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Salinity and Acidification</h3>
        <p> Projections: The salinity of Irish surface and intermediate water
          (up to the depth of 900-1000 m) naturally changes over time following
          several trends including inflow of waters from different regions (for
          example Mediterranean) and atmospheric processes from which the North
          Atlantic Oscillation is especially influential. Following the global
          trend of sub-polar waters freshening, Irish waters have become less
          saline from the 1960s to the1990s. In contrast, the last decade shows
          the opposite trend - an increase in levels of salinity which can be
          partly attributed to the inflow of Mediterranean waters that are
          particularly directed towards the west coast. However, Irish seas and
          coastal zones are likely to become more acidic following the global
          trend for ocean acidification at the higher latitudes.</p>
        <p>Risks: Both salinisation and acidification of sea waters represent
          significant threats for Irish coastal aquifers, and the composition of
          species, trophic webs and chemical processes taking place in sea
          waters. Acidification reduces production of calcium and therefore is
          especially harmful for calcifying organisms â€“ those whose life
          depends on shells, skeletons and calcium-based structures, causing
          mortality, migration and coral bleaching.</p>
        <p>Ecosystem changes will affect the coastal economy. Acidification
          impacts the reproduction of mussels and oysters - important commercial
          species for Irish aquaculture. Salinity and acidification may have
          direct and indirect effects on fish stocks and food chains and are
          considered among the most important long-term threats for the Irish
          fishing industry.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: Alteration of species may bring new opportunities for
          Irish fisheries if the industry will manage to identify changes and
          adapt to the new conditions including re-orientation of fisheries and
          local markets to new species. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Storminess and Wave Height</h3>
        <p> Projections: Several recent studies have indicated that the
          influence of climate change on Atlantic storm activity will result in
          increased extreme wind speeds, and an intensification of cyclones.
          These will contribute to a significant increase in the frequency of
          storm surges around the entire coast of Ireland for the period
          2031-2060, ranging from a 10% increase in frequency in Cork Harbour,
          to over 30% increases for Sligo Entrance and Clew Bay. Extreme surge
          heights will increase over the same period, with the northern and
          western coasts particularly hard hit.</p>
        <p>Surface wind speeds over the eastern Atlantic are projected to rise
          marginally in winter. Recent studies predict a measurable increase (up
          to 30cm) in wave height during the winter and autumn seasons in some
          west coast locations by 2060. Extreme wave heights have also been
          predicted to increase by up to 10% in the northwest of Ireland, with
          no significant change in the south and east.</p>
        <p>Risks: Waves are the most critical factor in determining coastal
          geomorphology. The wave energy regime, in conjunction with coastal
          lithography determines the rate at which the processes of coastal
          erosion and accretion will occur. Energy received at the coast
          (measured in joules/metre) is proportional to a wave height.
          Therefore, wave height and increasing storminess will increase the
          risk of erosion in the west and north, which is nevertheless largely
          offset by typically low erosion rate of the rocky north western shore.
          Most vulnerable to erosion are the soft-sedimentary eastern and
          southern coasts, which are likely to receive lower intensity of
          storms. Nevertheless, actual erosion rate and impact is defined by
          unique characteristic at each locality and studies should be made to
          assess potential local impacts of increased storminess.</p>
        <p>The most severe and dangerous flood events in Ireland are often those
          involving coastal inundation through storm surge. Projections of
          increased storminess also predict additional flood risk to coastal
          dwellers and critical infrastructure located at the coasts.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: Predictions for increasing storminess and wave height
          are currently seen as an important potential resource for renewable
          energy, contributing to national energy security and helping the
          transition towards a low-carbon economy. The wave energy resources of
          Irelandâ€™s western and northern coasts are likely to gradually
          increase by the 2060s. A projected increase of wind speed in the
          winter months also provides additional opportunities for wind energy
          production. However, in order to harness this potential, considerable
          steps must be taken in technological research and infrastructural
          development. </p>

        <h3 class="link">Coastal Erosion and Squeeze</h3>
        <p>Projections: Erosion is caused by a number of factors and many of
          them such are unique to a specific location. At present, the Irish
          coast loses approximately 1.6 km2 per year due to erosion and
          flooding. The erosion rate is higher for the south-east and eastern
          coasts which are predominantly formed of soft sediments (sand and
          glacial till), resulting in average shore retreat of 0.2-0.5 meters
          per year, rising to 1-2 meters per year in exposed locations. For the
          rocky shores of the south and west, land loss can be as little as 0.01
          meter per century. Sea level rise, increased storminess and wave
          height under climate change will likely intensify erosion rates,
          causing more intense loss of land and accelerated coastal squeeze.</p>
        <p>Risks: Until recently, erosion was not considered a significant
          problem in Ireland as most of the affected areas were sparsely
          populated. However, for the affected communities (e.g. at Douglas,
          Cork; Ballybunion; and Rosslare) loss of land and related damage of
          housing has been a significant problem.</p>
        <p>The recent expansion of coastal settlements significantly increased
          the number of people and businesses exposed to the risk of erosion.
          Notable examples are that of the rapid growth of the Dublin region
          towards the soft sedimentary shore of the Fingal coast, and the loss
          of valuable recreation lands and road infrastructure at Inch beach,
          Co. Kerry. The recent â€œCoastal shiftâ€ fuelled by a growing
          interest in Irish coastal resources such as coastal property, wind and
          wave energy tourism and aquaculture is likely to continue. With an
          increased risk of coastal erosion, loss of land and damage to coastal
          infrastructure (roads, housing) are likely become increasingly
          problematic in the near to medium term.</p>
        <p>Loss of land should, under natural conditions, lead to the migration
          of ecosystems and elements of the shore (such as dunes) landward;
          however, such movement requires space and time. The construction of
          hard defences (e.g. sea walls) as an immediate solution for coastal
          erosion may cause coastal squeeze in a longer run. Erosion caused by
          sea, coupled with human-induced destruction of a sea shore
          (unregulated recreation activity, grazing live-stock, extraction of
          sand and gravel) may cause rapid irreversible changes in the shore
          line and dune system also affecting the areas further in land which
          may lose their natural protection.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: there are no specific opportunities linked to coastal
          erosion. Nevertheless, adaptation measures such as restricted human
          activities (especially new construction) in the areas at risk, dune
          restoration and the managed retreat of affected lands to natural salt
          marshes may contribute to ecosystem health and the sustainable
          development of an area. Long-term planning may significantly minimise
          the risks of erosion. </p>

        <p> Projections: Rising sea level, increased storminess and changing
          seasonal climatic conditions such as wetter winters will increase the
          risk of coastal flooding. The western and southern coasts are
          particularly vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Risks: In recent years, severe flooding events have increased around
          Ireland, causing significant damage. Densely populated and
          economically important urban areas are at the greatest risk, as shown
          by the recent major floods affecting the major Irish cities - Dublin
          (October 2011), Cork, Limerick and Galway (November 2009). Floods also
          heavily affect key regional centres (e.g. Tralee, Bantry, others) and

          depends on such factors as urban planning, the design of dwellings and
          proportion of the population located in the vulnerable areas, the
          efficiency of sewage systems and utilisation of space inside
          properties. The traditional location of settlementsâ€™ centres,
          businesses and residential districts in low-lying areas, alongside
          major rivers and at the sea shore significantly increase their
          vulnerability and potential losses to flood damage. With the
          increasing frequency and intensity of floods these areas are likely to
          require additional investments in protection as well as increasing
          insurance cost.</p>
        <p>Opportunities: there are no specific opportunities linked to
          flooding. Nevertheless, adaptation measures such as strategic urban
          planning, restrictions on new developments in flood prone areas,
          timely information about floods and education on collective and
          individual action to minimise potential damage may contribute to the
          sustainable development of an area and significantly minimise flood
          risk. </p>
