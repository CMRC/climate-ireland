	  <div id="text-box">
	<b>Key Information</b>

	<li>Climate refers to global and regional weather patterns experienced over long time periods, typically a minimum of 30 years.</li>
	<li>Over the last 100 years, global mean temperature has risen by 0.74&deg;C and this is attributed to the emission of manmade greenhouse gases.</li>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	  <p>
		The earth's climate has always been changing however in its fourth assessment report, the IPCC conclude that there is <b>90% probability that the global warming of the last 50 years is due to man-made green house gases</b>.  This is due to the fact that that the earth's <a href="#greenhouse-effect">natural greenhouse effect</a>, which warms the planet, has been enhanced by manmade emissions of greenhouse gases and this has resulted in the problem of <a href="#global-warming">global warming</a> which is now taking place  at a much faster rate than previously expected.  Increased rates of global warming will result in changes in climatic stressors and in a wide variety of <a href="#impacts">climate impacts</a> which will affect Ireland's economy, environment and society both directly and indirectly.  
		</p>

		<a id="greenhouse effect"></a>
		<h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>
		<p>
		The earth has a natural greenhouse effect and this is due to the absorption of heat radiated from the earth and the lower atmosphere by gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.  These gases radiate heat back toward the earth's surface.  In the absence of this natural effect, the climate of the earth would be far colder than it is today.
		</p>
		<div class="picture"> <img src="/img/Greenhouse-effect.jpg"> <br />Radiation from the sun is reflected off the earth's surface.  Some of this radiation passes through the atmosphere to space while some is adsorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated back toward the earth</div>
		<p>
		<b>Throughout the Earth's history, natural and human factors have affected 
	    global climate</b>.  Examples of natural changes in climate include changes in the earth's orbit 
	    and volcanic eruptions while humans influence global climate in many ways, one of the most significant being through the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.  <b>Once emitted to the atmosphere, greenhouse gases absorb thermal radiation and re-radiate it in all directions</b>.  Some of this is reflected back towards the surface of the Earth and the lower atmosphere and results in the increase of the average surface temperature of the Earth.  <b>This process by which manmade emissions cause an increase in temperature is termed the 'Enhanced Greenhouse Effect'</b>.    
		</p>
		
		<a id="global-warming"></a>
		<h3>Global Warming</h3>
		<p>
		<b>The problem of global warming is a result of human activities</b> and, more specifically, to the burning of fossil fuels which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. A range of other activities also contribute to the release of greenhouse gases and these include but are not restricted to agricultural practices, vegetation fires, sewage treatment and the use of synthetic gases in refrigeration and air conditioning. These <b>additional greenhouse gases intensify the natural greenhouse effect and, as a result, warm the planet</b>.  The levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere in the distant past can be determined from bubbles of air trapped in ice.  Data indicate that as a result of human activities, <b>the current concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is 30% higher than at any time during at least the past 800,000 years</b> and this is enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and accelerating irreversible changes in the climate.

However, the last century has seen a dramatic increase in green house gas  Concentration units are ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per billion) (IPCC, 2007) </div>

		<h3>Climate Change Impacts</h3>
		
		<h4>Direct and Indirect Impacts</h4>
		
		<p>Climate change will have both direct and indirect effects, these are sometimes referred to as 'primary' and 'secondary' impacts.  Direct impacts will include increasing temperatures, more extreme weather conditions, an increased likelihood of river and coastal flooding, water shortages, changes in types and distributions of species and the possible extinction of vulnerable species.  Indirectly, climate change can lead to the disruption of ecosystem services, e.g. flooding of agricultural lands, or human processes, e.g. the breakdown of transport infrastructure.  Moreover,  Climate change will also impact upon other countries and in a globalising world; the consequences of climate change in distant places will affect Ireland.  For example, Irish companies have investments in many countries and Ireland is reliant upon foreign trade.</p> 

		<h4>Sudden Versus Slow Onset Impacts</h4>
		
		<p>Climate impacts cna also be distinguished between those that happen suddenly, such as extreme precipitation events or consequences thereof, and those that are slow onset, occurring gradually over time, these would include sea level rise.  </p>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p><a href="#global-change">Global climate is changing</a> on a  and this is particularly the case since the onset of the industrial period and the associated rapid increase in levels of emission of greenhouse gases, CO<sub>2</sub> in particular.  Reflecting global patterns of climate change, the last century has been a period of <a href="#ireland-change">unprecedented climate change in Ireland</a> and has seen, amongst others, increasing temperatures, changing patterns of precipitation, increasing sea level.  These observed changes have had already had impacts on many parts of Ireland's society, economy and environment and it is expected that over the coming century, these changes will continue and intensify.</p>
	
	 <a id="global-change"></a>
	 <h3>Global Climate Change</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>From 1906-2005, average global sir temperature has increased by 0.74&deg;C</b> and this increase in temperature is demonstrated by the fact that, in the northern hemisphere, the 1990s was the hottest decade of what has been the hottest century for a millennia.  The <b>rate of warming and the related changes will vary from region to region</b>.  However, the exact nature of these regional changes remains uncertain. 
		</li>
		<div class="picture"> <img src="http://66.39.23.222/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/global_temp.png"/> Red lines indicate temperatures above global average temperatures for the period 1901-2000 while blue lines represent temperatures below this average.  the brown line show variations in atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in parts per million(ppm)<NOAA/NCDC)<br/></div>
		<p>
		<li>Increasing temperatures have resulted in rising sea levels</b>.  Sea levels rise due to the thermal expansion of the oceans and the loss of land based ice due to melting.  After almost 2000 years of relatively little change in sea level, over the past century, sea level has risen at an average rate of 1.7 mm per year and in the past 15 years or so, it has been rising at an increased rate of 3.1 mm per year.</li>

		<h3>Climate Change in Ireland</h3> 
		</p>
		<ul><li>There has been an overall <b>increase in the mean annual temperature of Ireland of 0.8&deg;C between 1900 and 2011</b>.  The temperature has varied over the period with colder than normal episodes evident in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and some cold years in the 1960s and 1970s.  Higher temperatures were recorded from the 1930s to 1960 and since the late 1980s.  Notably, six of the ten warmest years on record have occurred since 1990.</li>

The red line represents a simple linear trend which has been fitted to the annual anomoly values while the blue curve shows the 11-year moving average.</br>
		</div>
		

		<li>There has been a <b>decrease in the number of frost days</b> (temperatures below 0&deg;C) and a shortening of the frost season duration.  In contrast, there has been an <b>increase in the number of warm days (temperature > 20&deg;C)</b>.  This is in line with trends evident for the rest of western Europe.</li>

		<li>For Ireland, it is difficult to assess local rates of sea level rise due to a lack of appropriate measurement data which has been corrected for glacial isostatic rebound.  However, an extensive network of tide guages are maintained  around the UK and these have been in operation for many years.  One of the longest records is available from the guage at Newlyn in Cornwall and these observations are thought indicitive of the situation in the south of Ireland.  These data indicate a rise in mean sea level of 1.7 (+/- 0.10mm) per year since 1916 and these changes have been attributed to climate-related change.</li>

		<li>There is some evidence of <b>change in patterns of precipitation</b>;  increased levels of precipitation are now evident in the north and west of the country while decreases or smaller increases in levels of precipitation are recorded in the south and east.

		<h3>Introduction</h3>	
		<p>In <a href="#developing-climate-models"> developing climate models</a>, scientists are trying to reduce the complex behaviour of the climate to a set of mathematical equations. Climate models are first developed for on a global basis, Global Climate Models (GCMs), and calibrated to simulate past climate.  Once the models accurately depict past climate, these models are then used to <a href="#projecting-future-climate">project how the climate might change in the future</a>.  However, in order to employ the outputs of global climate models for local or regional assessments of climate change, GCM outputs are <a href="#down-scaling">down-scaled</a> using a variety of techniques to provide a higher spatial resolution of the area of interest, this is known as down-scaling of climate models.  Nonetheless, developing climate models is a complex procedure and 
	    climate models cannot fully represent the complexity of our climate system.  As a result, there is 
	    still <a href="#uncertainty">considerable uncertainty</a> associated with projected climate information. However, recent developments in climate modelling, in addition to improved computing power, allow us to have greater confidence in our projections.</p>  
		
		
	   	<a id="developing-climate-models">
		<h3>Developing Climate Models</h3></a>
		<p>
		<b>Global Climate Models (GCMs) are mathematical representations of the climate system</b>.  In order to create a global climate model (GCM), the globe is divided into grid blocks or cell.  
	    These grid blocks will normally have a coarse resolution, covering 3-4 degrees across the globe (horizontal grid).  The finer the spatial resolution of the horizontal grid, the more spatially detailed the prediction.  In a similar way to the horizontal grid, the vertical profile of the atmosphere is divided into a number of different levels.    In contrast, to the horizontal grid, the vertical levels are not evenly spaced and simulate atmospheric processes, e.g. cloud formation.  
		</p>

		<p>
		For each horizontal cell and for all vertical levels, <b>GCMs try to simulate as much as possible about the climate system</b> including the incoming and outgoing solar radiation, the way clouds move and precipitation falls, the way ice sheets grow and shrink etc.  <b>GCMs also try to simulate how the different parts of the climate system interact with eachother</b>.<p>
		<p>
		In order to parameterise the model for the prediction of the future climate, climate models are first employed to simulate past and current climates and these simulations are compared to actual observations.  The models are then tuned, within reasonable boundaries, so that they approximate as closely as possible past and current climates.
		</p>
		
	  
	<a id="projecting-future-climate">
	<h3>Projecting future climate.</h3>
		
	<p>
	<b>Once parameterised to best represent past and current climate conditions, climate models are then employed to project future climate conditions</b>.  This is achieved by estimating levels of future emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases and using these estimates as inputs to the climate model.  This is termed as 'forcing' a climate model.  Currently, in forcing climate models to project possible climate futures, two sets of emission scenarios have largely been employed, the <b>Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)</b> and, more recently, the <b>Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)</b>.</p> 
	
	<a name="emission-scenarios">
	
	<p>
	<h4>SRES</h4>
	</p>
	<p><b>In order to assess a wide range of possible future emissions levels</b>, using different modelling approaches, <b>quantitative interpretations of what future levels of emission might be are developed and these are determined by predicting the future evolution of the main demographic, economic and technological driving forces of emission levels</b>.  <b>These alternative images of how the future greenhouse gas emissions might unfold are termed 'scenarios'</b>.  However,it is thought highly unlikely that any single emission path will occur as described in a single scenario.  <b>A set of scenarios</b>, each making different assumptions for greenhouse gas emissions, <b>has been developed to represent the range of driving forces and emissions</b> so as to best reflect current understanding and knowledge about an uncertain future.</p>
	
	<p>To add context to the scenarios, <b>each scenario is organised into four different narrative storylines or scenario families</b> which contain scenarios that are similar to eachother in some respects.</p>
	
	<p>As a result, for each storyline, several different scenarios were developed using different modelling approaches to examine the range of outcomes arising from a range of models that use similar assumptions about driving forces.  <b>A multi model approach encompasses the current range of uncertainty surrounding future levels of emissions arising from the different characteristics of these models, in addition to uncertainties that arise from scenario driving forces such as demographic, social and economic, and broad range of technological developments that drive these models</b></p>
	
	
	<p>On this basis, four narrative storylines were developed labelled A1, A2, B1 and B2.  In simple terms, the four storylines combine two sets of divergent tendencies: one set varying between strong economic and environmental values, the other between increasing globalisation and increasing regionalisation.</p>
	<div class="picture">
	<img src="http://climateandrisk.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/sres-scenarios.jpg"><br/>The four IPCC SRES narrative story lines have been developed according to two sets of divergent tendencies, one varying between strong economic and environmental values and the other between increasing globalisation and increasing regionalisation.</div>
	<a name="scenario families"></a>
	<ul>
	<li>The <b>A1 storyline</b> and family of scenarios represent a future world of <b>very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks mid-century and declines thereafter and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies</b>.  This story line also develops into three groups that describe alternatives in the development of energy supply: fossil fuel intensive (A1F1), non-fossil fuel energy sources (A1T) or a balance across all sources (A1B)</li>
	<li>The <b>A2 storyline</b> and family of scenarios is representative of a <b>heterogeneous world with continuously increasing population and regionally orientated economic growth that is more fragmented and slower than in the other storylines</b>.</li>
	<li>The <b>B1 storyline</b> and scenario family  represents <b>a convergent world with the same global population as the A1 scenario but with rapid changes in economic structures towards a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean resource-efficient technologies</b>.</li>
	<li>The <b>B2 storyline</b> and scenario family represents a world in which <b>the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability with continuously increasing population, albeit at a lower rate than A2, and intermediate economic development</b>.</li>
	
	<p>On the basis of the four narrative storylines, projected climates are computed for each grid block on the globe.</p> 
	
	<p>
	<h4>RCPs</h4>
	</p>
	<p>The <b>Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) are based on selected scenarios from four modelling teams</b> working on integrated assessment modelling, climate modelling and modelling and analysis of impacts and each of <b>the RCPs cover the period up to 2100</b>.  The RCPs differ from the SRES as <b>they refer to the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases as defined by their total radiative forcing</b> (cumulative measure of human emission from all sources expressed in Watts per square metre) rather than levels of emission of greenhouse gases.  Moreover, <b>each single RCP cannot be associated with a set of social, economic and technological assumptions</b>.  This is because any single radiative forcing pathway can result from a diverse range of socioeconomic and technological development scenarios.</p>
	
	<p>In conducting climate modelling with RCPs, four RCPs are employed:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>RCP 8.5</b>: Rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8.5/W/m<sup>2</sup> in 2100.</li>

	<h3>Down-scaling climate models for Ireland</h3>
	
	<p>
	<b>Despite the sophistication and complexity of GCMs, generally the output from these models is too course to be effectively employed in assessing regional or local impacts</b>.  This is because important variations occur due to processes operating at sub GCM grid scale.  Due to computational requirements, the grid box output for GCMs are generally in the order of 100s km.  In order to overcome these issues, regionalisation or down-scaling of GCM outputs is required. 
	</p>
	
	<div class="picture"> 
	  <img src="http://www.wmo.int/wcc3/bulletin/57_2_en/images/bull_57_2_9.jpg"/> <br/>Regional climate models (RCM) are nested within a global climate model (GCM).  Due to the computational requirements of developing climate projections for the entire globe, the spatial resolution of the GCM is relatively large. RCMs model climate for limited areas and as a result, the spatial resolution of the model is relatively high compared to GCMs and information such as detailed topography can be included.</div>
	  
	<p>
	For Ireland, Down-scaling of GCMs to regional scale has been achieved using two approaches: 1)by statistically downscaling the outputs of a GCM; 2) by dynamical down-scaling which fits outputs from GCM into a regional climate model (RCM).
	</p>  
	<p>
	<a name="statistical-downscaling"></a>
	<h4>Statistical down-scaling</h4>
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>statistical down-scaling approach converts GCM/global-scale outputs to regional scale conditions</b>. This is achieved by applying information from GCMs to a region by linking available climate observations to hindcasted GCM outputs.  On this basis, a predictive model is developed which is trained to match, as closely as possible, climate observations. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Advantages</b> of this approach include <b>less computational effort than dynamical down-scaling</b>, the <b>provision of fine scale information</b> providing there is a dense network of observation stations, and the <b>employment of ensemble GCM results</b> rather than a single GCM.
	</p>
	<p>
	<a name="dynamical-downscaling"></a>
	<h4>Dynamical down-scaling</h4>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Dynamical down-scaling fits outputs from GCMs into a Regional Climate Model (RCM)</b>.  The RCM is similar to a GCM but its spatial extent is limited to a portion of the globe.  As a result, RCM can be considered to be nested within a GCM and simulate the effects of climate change at sub-GCM grid squares.  Moreover, RCMs  use the lateral meteorological boundary conditions of the GCM and include highly resolved geographic information such as complex topography and coastlines.   <b>This allows for an improved climatic simulation for limited spatial areas, e.g. regional level, than would be provided for by GCMs</b>.
	</p>
	

	<p>Dynamical down-scaling has a number of <b>advantages</b> and these include <b>not being limited by available observations</b>, <b>full model outputs</b> which can be used to drive applications requiring highly resolved climate data, and the <b>potential for capturing meso-scale non-linear effects and providing coherent information among multiple climate variables</b></p>

	<h3>Sources of Uncertainty in Climate Model Projections</h3></a>
	<p>
	<b>Modelling future climate is a complex procedure</b> and although there have been large advances in modelling chaotic behaviour and natural variability in the climate system, it is not an exact science and <b>it is recognised that climate models will not be able to provide a singular projection of future climate</b>.
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>Unknowable knowledge</p>  
	<p>The <b>projections produced by climate models are based on future assumptions of socio-economic conditions, technological change and future population growth and their associated estimate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</b>.  In order to take these uncertainties into account, a range of future storylines detailing socio-economic conditions, technological change and future population growth are employed and these are termed scenarios.</p></li>
	<li><p>Uncertainty in model configuration.</p>
	<p>The <b>configuration of climate models to represent the climate system is an important step and is based on both scientific and computational considerations</b>.  For example, choices include the number of vertical and horizontal resolutions, physics parameterisation schemes, values of these parameters and numerical algorithms.  <b>As a result, different climate models will simulate different climatic responses to the same scenario</b>.  As we move to Regional Climate Models, uncertainty in climate model configuration increases.</p>
	<p>In order to overcome uncertainty in model configuration, a wide range or ensemble of climate models are employed, to provide a projection of an average climate.</p> 
	</li>
	<li><p>Uncertainty due to the random nature of natural forcing.</p>
	<p>The <b>climate system and its natural forcing are inherently stochastic or random</b>.  The <b>nature of future natural forcing are unknown</b> and although these are less important than the uncertainty associated with manmade forcing, these still <b>add uncertainty to the projection of future climate</b>.</p>

	  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	  
	  <p>International scientific evidence has shown that <b>human activities have begun to modify global climate 
	    and that these changes will have significant social and economic implications</b>.  The Fourth Assessment Report 
	    of the IPCC (2007) details projections from a range of global climate models and indicate that <b>significant 
	    impacts on world climate are likely to occur over the present century</b>.  The projected increase in global 
	    temperatures are unlikely to be uniformly distributed with increased rates of warming, nearly double the 
	    global  average, projected to occur at higher latitudes.  This <b>projected regional variation in global 
	    warming will also affect the distribution and rate of change in other meteorological variables</b>.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Key Projected Climatic Changes</h3>

	  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	  <p><a href="/ci/climate-change/climate-modelling#down-scaling" target="_blank">Observed changes</a> in Ireland's climate over the last century are in line with global and regional trends associated with human induced climate change <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Over the coming centuries, these changes are expected to continue and increase.</p>  
	  
	  <p>For Ireland, research effort <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>	has been directed toward <a href="/ci/climate-change/climate-modelling#down-scaling" target="_blank"> down-scaling</a> global climate projections for use at national and regional scales.  This work has been successful in refining the likely impacts of climate change for Ireland over the coming century. However, our knowledge of the climate system and our ability to model it remain incomplete and representations/projections of future climate are a mixture of theory, observations and experimentation and as a result are subject to uncertainty.</p>  
	  
	  <p>In order to increase our confidence in the robustness of future projections and take account of their uncertainties, many simulations have been made for Ireland using different models and emissions scenarios which are representative of the <a href="/ci/climate-change/climate-modelling#uncertainty" target="_blank"> key sources of uncertainties (unknowable knowledge; uncertainty in model configuration; uncertainty due to the random nature of natural forcing)</a>.  The ensuing results can be combined to form 'ensembles' (or combined projections).  Taking this ensemble approach overcomes the need to rely on any single climate projections and attempts to account for the key uncertainties inherent to climate modelling.</p>   
	  
	  <p>Although it is important that the limitations and caveats when employing climate projections are recognised, current climate models do simulate many aspects of global and regional climate with considerable skill; and capture, albeit imperfectly, all the major physical and biogeochemical processes known to be likely to exert a significant influence on global and regional climate over the coming century.</p>  
	  
	  <h3>Summary of Observed and Projected Climate Changes for Ireland</h3>
	  
	  <p>The following table presents an overview of observed and projected climatic changes for Ireland.  For climate projections, it is important to note that the key research work on which this table is based use a wide range of different climate models, emissions scenarios, downscaling techniques, impact models, and time period of simulation.  Therefore, in combination, they provide a good indication of the range of expected climate change for Ireland.</p>
