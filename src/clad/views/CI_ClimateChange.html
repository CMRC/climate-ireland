	    <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3></a>
	  <p>
	    <b>Climate refers to global or regional weather patterns experienced over long time periods, 
	      typically 30 years.</b>
	  </p>  
	  <p>
		<img src="/img/Greenhouse-effect.jpg" align="right" style="margin:5px">
		Throughout the earth's history, natural and human factors have affected 
	    global climate.  Examples of natural changes in climate include changes in the earth's orbit 
	    and volcanic eruptions while humans influence global climate through the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.   
		</p>
		<p>
		
		The earth has a natural greenhouse effect and this is due to the absorption of heat radiated from the earth and the lower atmosphere by gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.  These gases radiate heat back toward the earth's surface.  In the absence of this natural effect, the climate of the earth would be far colder than it is today.
		</p>
		<p>
		The problem of global warming is a result of human activities and, more specifically, to the burning of fossil fuels which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  These additional greenhouse gases intensify the natural greenhouse effect and, as a result, warm the planet.  As a result of human activities, the current concentration of CO<sup>2</sup> in the atmosphere is now 30% higher than at any time during at least the past 800,000 years.
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src="/img/atmos-co2.jpg" align="left" style="margin:5px">
		Over the last 100 years, climate is changing and in its fourth assessment report, the IPCC conclude that there is <b>90% probability that the global warming of the last 50 years is due to man-made green house gases</b>.  Global warming is now taking place  at a much faster rate than previously expected and poses a significant and imminent threat to Ireland.

	    <h3>Evidence of Climate Change</h3></a>
	  <p>
	    The global climate is changing and this is particularly the case since the onset of the industrial
	    period and its associated rapid increase in levels of emission of greenhouse gas emissions, CO<sup>2</sup> in 
	    particular.  
		</p>
		<p>
		
		From 1906-2005, average global temperature has increased by 0.74&deg;C and this increase 
	    in temperatures is reflected by the fact that, in the northern hemisphere, the 1990s was the hottest 
	    decade of what has been the hottest century for a millennia.  
	    </p>
		
		<p>
		Globally, an increase in temperature 
	    will cause: 
		<ul><li>Sea levels to rise and will change patterns of precipitation</li>  
		<li>The more frequent occurrence of extreme events such as droughts, 
	    heat waves, heavy rainfall events, species extinction and change in agricultural yields.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The rate of warming and the related changes will vary from region to region.  However, the exact nature of these regional changes remains uncertain. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Similar to global patterns of climate change, the last century has been a period of rapid climate change for Ireland:</b>  
		</p>
	  <ul><li>There has been an <b>increase in the mean annual temperature of Ireland of 0.7&deg;C during the 20<sup>th</sup> century</b> with a more rapid rate of increase evident since 
	      the 1980s</li>  
		  <li>The <b>highest ten-yearly rates of increase have occurred since 1980</b>, with a warming rate of 0.042&deg;C per decade</li>
		  <li>There has been a <b>decrease in the number of frost days</b> and shortening of the frost season duration</li>
	    <li>There has been a <b>change in patterns of precipitation</b>,  increased levels of precipitation 
	      are now evident in the north and west of the country while decreases or smaller increases in levels 
	      of precipitation are recorded in the south and east.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>These observed changes have had already had 
	    impacts on many parts of society,economy and environment and <b>it is expected that over the coming century, these changes 
	    will continue and intensify.</b></p>

	    <h3>Why is Climate Change Serious?</h3></a>
	  <p>
	  <img src="/img/cork-flood-2.JPG" align="right" style="margin:0 10px 10px 10px"> Climate change poses a significant and imminent threat to Ireland.  Climate change is not just an 
	    environmental issue, it affects all aspects of life as we know it and its effects will be felt across 
	    all sectors.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the coming century, we can expect, amongst others:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>higher sea levels;</li> 
	    <li>more storms and more intense storms;</li> 
	    <li>warmer temperatures and warmer waters;</li> 
	    <li>and more flooding, summer droughts and changing rainfall patterns.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>These changes will put Ireland at risk, both directly and indirectly.  For example, storms and violent winds could affect critical infrastructure, summer droughts could put 
	    a strain on water supplies, floods could submerge homes and businesses, rising sea levels and increased 
	    storm surges could threaten all of Ireland's cities.</p>

	  <p>
		<img src="/img/earth-4.jpg" align="left">
		<b>Climate models comprise a range of mathematical 
	    equations that are representative of various parts of the Earth's climate system.</b></p>  
		<p>In developing climate models, scientists are trying to reduce the complex behaviour of the climate down to a set of mathematical equations. <b>These models allow us to predict how the climate might change in the future.</b>  However, developing climate models is a complex procedure and 
	    climate models cannot fully represent the complexity of our climate system.  As a result, there is 
	    still considerable uncertainty associated with predicted climate information. Nonetheless, recent developments in climate modelling, in addition to improved computing power, allow us to have greater confidence in our predictions.  
		</p>
	   	<b>Developing Climate Models</b>
		<p>
		<img src="/img/climate-model-3.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 10px">
		In order to create a global climate model (GCM), the globe is divided into grid blocks or cell.  
	    These grid blocks will normally have a coarse resolution, covering 3-4 degrees across the globe (horizontal grid).  The finer the spatial resolution of the horizontal grid, the more spatially detailed the prediction.  In a similar way to the horizontal grid, the vertical profile of the atmosphere is divided into a number of different levels.    In contrast, to the horizontal grid, the vertical levels are not evenly spaced and simulate atmospheric processes, e.g. cloud formation.  
		</p>
		<p>
		For each horizontal cell and for all vertical cells, GCMs try to simulate as much as possible about the climate system including the incoming and outgoing solar radiation, the way clouds move and precipitation falls, the way ice sheets grow and shrink etc.  GCMs also try to simulate how the different parts of the climate system interact with eachother.<p>
		<p>
		In order to parameterise the model for the prediction of the future climate, climate models are first employed to simulate past and current climates and these simulations are compared to actual observations.  The models are then tweaked, within reasonable boundaries, so that the model does as well as possible at simulating past and current climates.
		</p>
		<b>Projecting future climate</b>
		<p>
		<img src="/img/sres-emissions.gif" align="left">
		Once parameterised to best represent past and current climate conditions, climate models are then employed to project future climate conditions.  This is achieved by estimating levels of future CO<sup>2</sup> emission and using these estimates as inputs to the climate model.  This is termed as 'forcing' a climate model.  In order to assess a wide range of possible climate futures, climate models are forced by a wide range of emission scenarios (from high levels of emission to low levels.  The level of emission is determined based on prediction of future social, economic and environmental conditions. Projected climates are computed for each grid block on the globe.

	  <a name="Projections of Global Climate Change"><h3>Projections of Global Climate Change</h3></a>
	  <p>International scientific evidence has shown that human activities have begun to modify global climate 
	    and that these changes will have significant social and economic implications.  The Fourth Assessment Report 
	    of the IPCC (2007) details projections from a range of global climate models and indicate that significant 
	    impacts on world climate are likely to occur over the present century.  The projected increase in global 
	    temperatures are unlikely to be uniformly distributed with increased rates of warming, nearly double the 
	    global  average, projected to occur at higher latitudes.  This projected regional variation in global 
	    warming will also affect the distribution and rate of change in other meteorological variables.</p>
	  <ul>	
	    <li>Global temperatures are projected to increase by between 1.8°C to 4.0°C by 2080 - 2099</li>
	    <li>An increase in the occurrence of hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events is likely to occur</li>
	    <li>An increase in levels of precipitation is projected for the mid to high latitudes with reductions projected for the low latitudes.</li>
	    <li>A widespread decrease in mountain glaciers is expected while snow cover is also projected to contract and the upper layers of permafrost are projected to melt</li>
	    <li>Antarctica is to gain mass due to enhanced snowfall.  In contrast, Greenland is likely to lose mass due a greater relative increase in runoff.  The extent of summer sea ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctica is projected to decrease and, according to some model predictions, summer sea ice in the Arctic is expected to
		disappear towards the end of this century.</li>
	    <li>Globally, sea level is expected to rise by between 0.28 m and 0.43 m by the end of the century</li>
	    <li>Storm track locations are projected to shift polewards while the number of tropical cyclones per year is likely to decrease.  However, the intensity of these storms is expected to increase.</li>   
	    <li>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), of which the Gulf Stream is a part, is estimated to reduce by 25% during the present century.  However, an abrupt transition during this period is unlikely.</li>

	  <p>Observed changes in Ireland's climate over the last century are in line with global and regional trends associated with human induced climate change.  Over the coming centuries, these changes are expected to continue and increase.</p>  
	  <ul>
	    <li>Temperatures are expected to increase by 1-3°C by the end of the century while the frequency of heat waves are expected to increase and the frequency of cold snaps are expected to decrease.</li>
	    <li>Winters are expected to be wetter in the west of Ireland while summers are expected to be drier in the southeast of Ireland (5-25% less rainfall in 2021 to 2060 compared to 1961-2000).</li>
	    <li>Storm frequency is expected to decrease but the intensity of these storms if expected is increase. Storm tracks are also projected to shift northwards.</li>
	    <li>Sea level is projected to rise by up to 60 cm by the end of the century and these changes are expected to magnify the impacts of changing storm surge and wave patterns in coastal areas.</li>
