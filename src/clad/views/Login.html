 <h3>The Status Of Ireland's Climate, 2012</h3>

 <p>The annual average surface air temperature in Ireland has increased by approximately 0.8 degrees Celcius over the last 110 years. This is just one of the changes in our climate documented in The Status of Irelands Climate, 2012, launched by the EPA in Dublin on 7th February 2013. Dr. Ned Dwyer, CMRC, compiled information on over 40 variables across the atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial domains, detailing trends in everything from rainfall amount to ocean temperature to changes in land cover.</p> 
 
 <p>This study demonstrates that Ireland's climate is changing. These changes are consistent with regional and global trends, but local patterns of change are evident. It is essential that Ireland’s climate observation system is maintained and enhanced in order to have the information required to understand these changes to enable planning for appropriate adaptation.</p>
