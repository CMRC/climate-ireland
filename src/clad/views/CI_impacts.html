	<h2>Coastal Erosion</h2>
	<div id="text-box">
	<p>Approximately 20% of Ireland's coast is at risk of coastal erosion.  Sea level rise combined with an increase in the severity of coastal storms is expected to exacerbate these problems.</p>
	</div>
	<p>
	Coastal erosion is the process whereby the coastline is worn away by the sea through primarily wave actions and tidal currents and is a natural phenomenon which has shaped our coastal landscapes.  Waves are the most important erosive agent, their effect on rates of erosion varies with wave energy and characteristics and also the nature of the material exposed to wave attack.  For example where a coast is formed by steep cliffs which plunge straight into deep water, waves are not forced to break before they impact and as a result, waves are reflected with little loss of energy and rarely cause erosion.  In contrast, for coastlines that are more commonly associated with with breaking waves, a considerable amount of kinetic energy is displaced as they break on the shoreline.  Breaking waves, plunging breakers in particular, through the combined effect of air compression and the impact of a considerable mass of water will dislodge loose particles and fractured rock.  Breaking waves may also throw particles against the shore and this can lead to the abrasion of shoreline material.</p>  
	
	<p>Once eroded, coastlines may stabilise but the lost sediment can never be replaced.  However, coastal erosion, as well as soil erosion in catchments is the main process which provide terrestrial sediment to the coastal system including beaches, dunes, reefs, mudflats and marshes.  These systems then provide a range of functions including absorption of wave energies, nesting and hatching fauna, protection of freshwater, or location for recreational activities.  Increasingly, human influence (urbanisation and economic activities) in the coastal zone has turned coastal erosion from a natural phenomena into a problem of increasing intensity.  Human-induced factors of particular concern are the construction of hard-coastal defences which include seawalls, dykes, breakwaters, jetties or any other structures which aims to protect assets landward of the coastline.  These constructions can exacerbate the problem of coastal erosion by impacting upon coastal processes such as sediment transport and result in amongst others:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	Trapping of sediment transported along shore and as a result, a sediment deficit downdrift due to fact that in contrast to natural coastlines, hard structures do not provide sediment for the alongshore drift.  Such processes are evident at Rosslare Harbour, Ireland.</li>
	<li>Incoming waves reflected by hard structures mean that wave energy is not dissipated and results in increased turbulence and cross-shore erosion</li>
	<li>As a result of the proximity of structure, wave diffraction occurs which is the alteration of the direction of wave crests.  This results in wave energy being either diluted in some places or concentrated in others.
	</li>
	<li>Land reclamation projects undertaken in tidal bays or basins in particular result in a reduction of the tidal volume and therefore a change in the ebb and flow currents transporting sediments.  As a result, coastlines thought to be relatively stable may begin to erode.</li>
	<li>River regulation works (e.g. Damming) impact coastal processes by impacting upon sediment discharge and may results in a sediment deficit at the river mouth and subsequent sediment erosion
	</li>
	<li>Dredging for amongst others, navigational and construction purposes affects coastal processes by removing from the foreshore material which protect the coast against erosion, by causing a sediment deficit and by modifying the water depth.</li>
	<li>Vegetation clearing, changing of landuse and landcover can decrease the resistance of areas to erosion.  This is because vegetation can provide stability to eroding cliff faces, dunes or beaches and minimizes water infiltration.</li>
	<li>Ship induced waves impacts upon natural wave climatology and wave energy provoked by ships can result in increased coastal erosion.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Current erosion patterns for Ireland</b>
	
	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="/img/eurosion_ireland.jpg"/> <br/>
	</div>
	<p>The coastline of Ireland is highly varied with differing exposures and it is currently estimated that 20% of Ireland's coastline is subject to coastal erosion.  The coasts most susceptible to coastal erosion are those composed of unconsolidated (soft) sediment comprising of glaciated debris, sandy beaches, sand and gravel barriers and machair.  These areas are most common on Ireland's eastern and southern coasts and also in isolated areas, sedimentary bays, on western and northern coasts (e.g. the Shannon estuary, Donegal, Clew, Tralee and Dingle Bays).  Many of these soft coasts are low-lying, at less than 10-12 amsl  Rates of erosion for these areas average 0.2-0.5m/yr but often reach values of 1-2m/yr.  In contrast, for the rocky shores of the south and west, land loss can be as little as 0.01 m/century.  The effects of this erosion are visible as:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Rapid cliff retreat;</li>
	<li>onland movement of dunes and other barriers;</li>
	<li>and on beaches, the lowering of levels with the loss of finer sediments</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Implications of Climate Change for Rates of Coastal Erosion in Ireland</b>
	
	<p>
	Climate change predicts an increase in relative sea level and changing storminess.  For Ireland predictions indicate the occurrence of fewer, storms concentrated in the winter season, but more intense storms with the southwest and northeast regions in particular becoming more stormy and changing storminess is predicted to have a greater impact on rates of coastal erosion than relative sea level rise.  However, rising sea levels will serve to amplify the effects of coastal storms on rates of erosion. Under climate change scenarios, c. 1700 km of the coastline is at particular risk of coastal erosion and under storminess impacts, we can expect rates of erosion at these vulnerable locations to increase.  Rates of increase will be determined by local coastal circumstances, e.g. geology, coastal configuration - exposure, sediments, supply factor.
	</p>
	<p>Loss of land under natural conditions leads to the migration of ecosystems and elements of the shore landward.  However, such natural migrations require both space and time.  The construction of hard defences to mitigate against coastal erosion may result in coastal squeeze in the longer term.  Moreover, erosion caused by the sea, coupled with human-induced changes to the shoreline may cause irreversible changes in the shoreline and the dune system and also affect areas further inland due to the loss of natural protection.

	<p>Flooding from estuaries or the sea is generated from sea levels (a combination of astronomical tides, surges, wind sand waves) exceeding the level of an hence spilling onto the neighbouring land.</p>
	  
	<b>Sea Level Rise</b>  
	<p>Sea level rise is is primarily a result of increasing global temperatures which causes thermal expansion of the oceans and the loss of land-based ice (e.g. glaciers and ice sheets, permafrost) due to increased melting.  In addition, relative sea level rise is determined by isostatic glacial adjustment.  Around 20,000 years ago, parts of the earth's surface were covered in several kilometre thick ice sheets and this resulted in depression of the underlying earths surface. Once the pressure of the ice was removed, the underlying surface started and continues to rebound due to decreased pressure.  Moreover, and amongst others, spatial variations in relative sea level are determined by spatial variations in sea surface heating and ocean circulation.   As a result, sea level and rates of sea level rise vary globally.</p>
	   
	<p>Globally, sea level rise has risen by an average of 1.7 mm per year through the 20th century.  However, for the period 1993 to 2012, a significant increase in the rate global of sea level rise has been observed.  Satellite measurements indicating an average rise of 3.18 mm per year.  For Ireland, long term observational data from tide gauges which provide measurements of sea level relative to the land are deficient to make accurate estimates of sea level rise.  However, satellite observations suggest that the sea level around Ireland has increased by 2-3 mm per year since the early 1990s although this data must be used with caution as satellite measurements need to be carefully calibrated, the most common method being the use of tide gauges.  In addition to measurements from Ireland, an extensive network of tide gauges situated around the UK provide some evidence.  Analysis of these data indicate a mean sea level rise of 1.7 mm per year since 1916.  This rise has been attributed to climate related changes and are thought indicative of the situation to the south of Ireland.  
	</p>
	
	<b>Projected Changes in Sea Level</b>
	<p>Globally, projected sea level rise for the period to 2100 are in the range of 0.09-0.88 m with a mean figure from all climate models of 0.48 m.  However, when examining the impacts of projected rates of sea level rise for Ireland, the effect of isostatic rebound is of importance. Spatial variations in rates of isostatic rebound rates for Ireland are a result of the location of main ice sheet where the maximum weight was concentrated.  In Ireland, the ice sheet was centred in the north and as a result, in these areas the greatest depression of land took place.  South of a line from Galway to Dublin, isostatic rebound is slight while to the north, the land is continuing to rise.  As a result, areas of the south will likely feel the affects of sea level rise first, particularly low-lying coastal locations situated on soft or easily eroded materials and coastal floodplains.   In addition, projected changes in sea levels are expected to enlarge the horizontal and vertical extent of estuaries.  This will result in the penetration of tides further upstream and would impede the flow of rivers and result in estuarine flooding.</p>
	
	<b>Projected Changes in Storm Surges</b>
	<p>
	Due to Ireland's location location on the west of Europe, exposure to Atlantic storms is of concern and this is particularly the case in the context of rising sea levels.  According to the IPCC, there is likely to be an increase in the number of intense cyclones and associated strong winds, particularly over the North Atlantic.  These changes will have a direct impact on storm surges which are caused by low pressure and strong winds.  Moreover, rising sea levels will enhance the impacts of storm surges.  For Ireland,  modelling results indicate that for Irish waters storm surge heights are increasing in frequency around all Irish coastal areas and by up to 20% in the north and west.  There is also an increase in extreme storm surge heights along the west and east coasts, with most of the extreme surges occurring in winter.  As a result, when combined with projected increases in coastal storms in winter, sea level rise may result in inundation of coastal areas and this could have major economic, social and environmental implications as all Ireland's major cities are located on the coast.  This is particularly the case for when wind-driven storm surges coincide with high tides. </p>

	<a name="Inland Flooding">
	
	<h2>Inland Flooding</h2>
	<p>
	Projected climatic change, changes in precipitation patterns and rate of evapotranspiration in particular, is likely to result in changes in the hydrological cycle and increased flood risk.  Inland flooding is a function of rates of precipitation and evaporation and also catchment characteristics.  The main distinction between catchment characteristics is catchment storage which is dependent upon processes such as infiltration, the porosity and type of subsurface material.  In addition, to the basic hydrological parameters, human activities such as the development of land-use and infrastructure interventions (e.g. reservoirs and flood defences) also affect flood hazard.
	</p>
	<p>
	Long-term records of riverflow for Ireland indicate an increasing trend and this is particularly the case for annual and winter high flows.  For the future, climate change projections of precipitation for Ireland indicate changes in both the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation and these changes will have a direct effect on flood risk.  Projections indicate that precipitation will become increasingly seasonal with winters becoming significantly wetter (20%) by the mid to late 20th century and summers direr.  Moreover, the occurrence of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase.  This indicates that flood risk will increase significantly.  Spatially, the identification of areas at particular risk form future flood events still remains unclear as there still remains a high degree of uncertainty related to spatial variations in future precipitation. 
	</p>
	<b>Projecting future Changes in Inland Flooding</b>
	<p>
	In order to assess how climate change will affect hydrology and water resources, projected climate data is employed to drive hydrological models.  These models have been developed/parameterized for specific catchments. As a result, in assessing future catchment hydrology, there is a high degree of uncertainty due to choice of down-scaling technique, structure and parametrisation of the hydrological model, while external uncertainties relate to the choice of emission scenario, climate model selection and structure.  Nonetheless, projected changes in hydrological regimes have been developed for a wide range of catchments in Ireland.  Overall, modelling result indicate that increased precipitation will result in an increase in winter stream flow and coupled with the predicted increase in extreme precipitation events, an elevated risk of flooding.  However, individual catchment responses will be determined by their respective catchment characteristics.  For the most part, increasing stream flow has been projected to occur for those catchments with fast response times, i.e. little capacity to store water. For example, for the Blackwater and Bandon catchments, flows estimated for a 40 year return period in the past are projected to have a return period of 9.8 and 8.5 years respectively in the period 2021-2060.
	</p>
	<p>
	The increase in magnitude and frequency of flood events would suggest significant impacts for areas already at risk of flooding.  Moreover, for these areas, flood defences that have been built according to design standards based on the probability of floods in the current climate may be at risk of failure under future conditions.  In addition, the magnitude of change would indicate that areas currently not prone to flood risk may become more prone to flooding in the future.  This is particularly the case for those areas located at the confluence of major rivers or those areas located around estuaries where increased sea level rise in combination with increased river outflow may cause extensive estuarine flooding.

	<h2>Water Scarcity</h2>
	<div id="text-box">
	In Ireland, water resources are dominated by surface waters with groundwaters making a relatively small contribution to drinking water supply.  However, many areas rely on groundwaters resources.  Projections indicate decreased levels of precipitation during the summer months and this will lead to significant decreases in levels availability of water.
	</div>
	<p>
	Availability of fresh water through surface and groundwater flows is determined by the seasonality of precipitation and temperature, as well as by catchment characteristics such as geology, soils and landcover.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns modify the annual water budget of river basins as well as the timing and seasonality of river flows.  Currently in Ireland, water demand is expected to at the limit of projected supply capacity by 2015.
	</p>
	
	<p>Projected climate change indicates a decrease in levels of precipitation which will affect not only water supply but also water quality.  Moreover, increasing demand on limited water resources will require careful management.  This is particularly the case as projected periods of decreased water availability are likely to occur during periods of high demand, i.e. summer.  Moreover, projected temperatures indicate warmer summers which will result in increasing levels of demand.  For example, due to increased temperatures, water will be required for the irrigation of crops. 
	Currently, there remains a high degree of uncertainty in relation to the future locations of water resources in Ireland.  This is a reflection of the high degree of model spread in identifying future locations in receipt of high levels of rainfall. Nonetheless, climate projections indicate with a relatively high degree of certainty the

	<a name="Loss of Biodiversity">
	<h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
	
	<p>Ireland's biodiversity is determined by a range of factors of which climate plays a pivotal role.  This is because for most species and habitats, climatic tolerances are largely fixed.  For example, blanket bogs are rare on a global scale and their distribution restricted to temperate maritime regions characterised by cool summers, mild winters and year round rainfall.  As a result, a change in climate, both in the climate average and also in the frequency of climatic extremes, will have significant implications on the distribution of species and habitats.  Moreover, for Ireland, the impacts of climate changes on species are likely to be influenced by its island nature which means that the potential for species extinction is greater and survival of species is more precarious than on the continental landmass. Many aspects of Ireland's biodiversity are already at risk from a variety of pressures (e.g. intensification of agriculture, poorly managed commercial forestry, peat extraction, land clearance and development, climate change and invasive alien species) and climate change will add to these. As a result, in assessing the possible impacts of climate change on biodiversity, it is essential to account for other drivers of change.
	</p>
	
	<b>Observed changes in Biodiversity</b>
	<p>
	Over the recent past, warming temperatures have resulted in observed changes in the distribution of species.  For terrestrial environments, globally, there has been a consistent shift of species poleward or toward higher altitudes.  However, this shift in species is counterbalanced for many species by a lack of suitable habitats.  Moreover, this shift has favoured warm species while those species more suited to cold conditions and at limit of their northerly range are under threat as temperatures increase.  The arrival of the two new breeding bird species - the Mediterranean gull and the little egret, have extended their range into Ireland since the mid 1990s.  For marine environments, species are shifting from areas of cold to warm waters.  Increasing temperatures will also impact upon the lifecycle events of species and stimulate an earlier spring onset of various biological events.  For example, from 30 years of data, from 4 phenological gardens throughout Ireland, leaves are emerging on trees earlier each year indicating that the beginning of the growing season is starting earlier.  Moreover, alterations in the timing and intensity of the spring algal blooms are clear signs of a response to climate warming.  Climate change will also provide opportunities for invasive species an for Ireland, as an island nation, this is particularly important.  For example, <i>Rhododendron</i>(<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>) is particularly detrimental to peatlands by competing for space and once established, spreading quickly. Currently, In Ireland 10 fens, 7 raised and 10 blanket bogs are already threatened by <i>Rohododendron ponticum</i>.
	</p>
	<b>Projected implications of Climate Change on Ireland's Biodiversity</b>
	<p>
	For the terrestrial environment, key climatic changes include warmer and drier summers with a longer growing season.  The increased occurrence of extreme weather events will also likely have detrimental effects on terrestrial species and habitats.  Plant species particularly threatened by climate change are species that are already threatened due to a variety of factors and reasons; species that occur in restricted or vulnerable habitats; species that are particularly prone to loss due to competition from invasive alien plants; species that may be adversely affected by related changes to the biodiversity in their ecosystems.  Changes in species distribution and or their functioning will likely have a significant impact on the habitats that they constitute.  For example, the loss of habitats in many areas is expected to due to a shift in habitat conditions.  However, if the biological elements are unable to migrate, then the new habitat areas may be of lower quality for many species.  Based on an initial assessment, the most vulnerable habitats are: Raised Bogs, Blanket Bogs, Cladium Fens and Petrifying Springs.
	</p>	

	<p>For the coastal and marine environment, key changes include increasing sea surface temperatures, storm intensity, wave height and sea level. For coastal areas, increased intensity of coastal storms and seal level rise will result in increased inundation of low lying areas (e.g. sand dunes and coastal lagoons) and erosion of soft coastlines, interfering with coastal habitats.  Increasing seawater temperatures will result in the northerly shifts in the ranges of planktonic and other species, including migratory fish, and a decline in some wild populations.  This shift will also have consequences for the occurrence of invasions by non-native species. Increases in phyto plankton biomass and changes in the timing and intensity of spring algal blooms and the structure of the zooplankton communities will have consequences, potentially substantive, on marine food webs.  Elevated summer and winter temperatures in areas of shallow water, bays and inlets, will impact upon the structure and stability of marine plant and animal communities.  Alterations in river discharges and increasing sea levels will impact upon near-shore salinities, sediment loading and distribution and will effect near-shore ecosystems.
