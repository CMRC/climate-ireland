<h2>Climate Hazard Scoping Tool</h2>

<p>The Climate Hazard Scoping Tool has been designed to provide information on the key climatic hazards of concern for sectoral and spatial planners in Ireland.  Climatic hazards are the physical manifestation of climatic variability or change, e.g. eroding shorelines and flooding extent.</p>

<p>The tool adopts a vulnerability approach to each climate impact and failitates users in considering their current level of exposure to climatic hazards.  This is achieved through an examination of current levels of exposure to climatic hazards, providing a baseline/reference, against which we can then examine our potential exposure due to projected climate change.</p>

<p>The Climate Hazard Scoping Tool provides:</p>
<ul><li>An understanding of the climatic impact;</li>
<li>An examination of current levels of exposure to the impact;</li>
<li>Case study examples to illustrate current exposure and potential impacts;</li>
<li>An examination of projected future exposure to the impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get started, use the map to begin exploring the impacts of concern</p>

      <h2>Coastal Erosion</h2>
      <div id="key-info">
	<p>Ireland has a coastline of approximately 7400 km which comprises of extensive rock-dominated coasts along the southwestern, western and northern regions while the east and south-eastern regions are composed of soft sediments and fewer rocky exposures.  The west coast is also characterised by major sedimentary areas in the form of large bays and estuaries.  Currently, approximately 20% of Ireland's coast is at risk of coastal erosion and projected sea level rise combined with a projected increase in the severity of coastal storms is expected to exacerbate these problems.  These projected changes are expected to cause Ireland's coastal wetlands and soft sedimentary systems to be among the first in Europe to respond to storm-led SLR.</p>

	<h3>Coastal Erosion</h3> 
	
	<h4>A natural phenomena</h4>
	<p>Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon which has shaped our coastal landscapes and is the process whereby the coastline is worn away by the sea through wave and storm actions and tidal currents. Coastal erosion also provides sediments to the coastal system through deposition of eroded materials in areas of aggregation which include beaches, dunes, reefs, mudflats and marshes.  These systems then provide a range of functions including absorption of wave energies, nesting and hatching fauna, protection of freshwater and location of recreational activities.</p> 
        
      
	<h4>Human Influence on rates of coastal erosion</h4>
	  
    <p>Increasingly, human influence (urbanisation and economic activities) in the coastal zone has turned coastal erosion from a natural phenomena into a problem of increasing intensity.  Human-induced factors of particular concern are the construction of hard-coastal defences which include seawalls, dykes, breakwaters, jetties or any other structures which aim to protect assets landward of the coastline.  These constructions can exacerbate the problem of coastal erosion by impacting upon coastal processes such as sediment transport and result in amongst others:
    </p>
    
	<ul class="no-indent">
	<li>
	  Trapping of sediment transported along shore and as a result, a sediment deficit downdrift due to the fact that in contrast to natural coastlines, hard structures do not provide sediment for alongshore drift.  Such processes are evident at Rosslare Harbour, Ireland;</li>
	<li>Incoming waves reflected by hard structures mean that wave energy is not dissipated and results in increased turbulence and cross-shore erosion;</li>
	<li>Wave diffraction occurs due to the proximity of hard structure and this results in wave energy being either diluted in some places or concentrated in others;
	</li>
	<li>Land reclamation projects undertaken in tidal bays or basins in particular result in a reduction of the tidal volume and therefore a change in the ebb and flow currents transporting sediments.  As a result, coastlines thought to be relatively stable may begin to erode;</li>
	<li>River regulation works (e.g. Damming) impact coastal processes by impacting upon sediment discharge and may results in a sediment deficit at the river mouth and subsequent sediment erosion;
	</li>
	<li>Dredging for, amongst others, navigational and construction purposes affects coastal processes by removing from the foreshore material which protect the coast against erosion, by causing a sediment deficit and by modifying the water depth;</li>
	<li>Vegetation clearing, changing of landuse and landcover can decrease the resistance of areas to erosion.  This is because vegetation can provide stability to eroding cliff faces, dunes or beaches and minimizes water infiltration;</li>
	<li>Ship induced waves impacts upon natural wave climatology and wave energy provoked by ships can result in increased coastal erosion.</li>
    </ul>
        
	<a id="current-erosion"></a>
	<h3>Current erosion patterns for Ireland</h3>
          
    <p>Ireland's coast is exposed to high wave energy with breaking swells on Atlantic coasts reaching heights of up to 3m while on the east coast, wave heights are lower and between 0.5 - 2 m..  The coastline of Ireland is highly varied with differing levels of exposure to erosion and it is currently estimated that 20 - 25% of Ireland's coastline is subject to coastal erosion <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  The coasts most susceptible to coastal erosion are those composed of unconsolidated (soft) sediment comprising of glaciated debris, sandy beaches, sand and gravel barriers and sand plains (machair) <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  These areas are most common on Ireland's eastern and southern coasts and also in isolated areas, sedimentary bays, on western and northern coasts (e.g. the Shannon estuary, Donegal, Clew, Tralee and Dingle Bays).  Many of these soft coasts are low-lying, at less than 10-12 m above mean sea level and rates of erosion for these areas average 0.2-0.5 metres per year but often reach values of 1-2 metres per year <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  The effects of this erosion are visible as 'rapid' cliff retreat; onland movement of dunes and other barriers and on beaches, the lowering of levels with the loss of finer sediments.  In contrast, for the rocky shores of the south and west, land loss can be as little as 0.01 metres per century <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  Erosion episodes in these areas are generally characterised by sudden 'rock falls' or landslides.</p>

    <h3>Projected Changes in Rates of Coastal Erosion for Ireland</h3>
    
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right">
	<img src="/img/storm-surge-wang et al-2004.jpg">
	<figcaption>Projected changes (%) in the 10 year return period of a winter maximum storm surge between the future (2031-2060) and past control period (1961-1990)<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>. </figcaption></figure>  
    
	<p>
	Climate change projections indicate an increase in relative sea level and also a change in the frequency and magnitude of coastal storms <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  For Ireland, projections indicate the occurrence of fewer	but more intense storm surges concentrated in the winter season with the southwest and northeast regions in particular being affected<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.  These changes are projected to have a greater impact on rates of coastal erosion than relative sea level rise.  This is because temporary changes in extreme water levels and energy can have significant and lasting effects on coastal morphology through impacts on the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, and through the reworking of material which may be in equilibrium with the existing coastal energy regime.  However, rising sea levels will serve to amplify the effects of coastal storms on rates of erosion.</p> 
			
	<p> Currently, c. 1700 km of the coastline is at particular risk of coastal erosion and as a result of climate change, we can expect rates of erosion at these vulnerable locations to increase.  Rates of increase will be determined by local coastal circumstances, e.g. geology, coastal configuration - exposure, sediments, supply factor.  For Ireland,  areas of the extreme southwest, from the Dingle Peninsula to Cape Clear, are likely to experience the largest increases at a rate of 3.3-4.8 mm per year while areas of the north east coast are likely to experience a rate of 2.2-3.7 mm per year <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>. As a result, areas of the south will likely feel the affects of sea level rise first, particularly low-lying coastal locations situated on soft or easily eroded materials and coastal floodplains. </p> 
	 
	 <a id="implications-management"></a>
	 <h3>Implications for Management</h3>
	 
	 <p>Coastal erosion is currently a problem for Ireland and this is particularly the case where infrastructure or ecosystem services are at risk.  Projected changes in sea level and in the occurence of more intense coastal storms and surges mean that areas currently at risk will be at greater risk under projected changes in climate.</p> 
	 
	 <p>In the short-term, a number of measures might be taken:</p>
	 
	 <ul>
	 <li>
	 Identify and monitor areas currently at risk of coastal erosion;
	 </li>
	 <li>Strengthen the knowledge base of coastal erosion and processes in order to ensure that appropriate measures are taken locally that will not generate problems of coastal erosion or other environmental problems elsewhere.
	 </li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <p>In the medium to long term:</p>
	 <li>Move away from piecemeal solutions to coastal erosion management and planning and adopt a more strategic appraoch;</li>
	<li>Restore the sediment balance;</li>
	<li>Allocate the space necessary to accomadate natural and coastal sediment processes.</li>

	  <p>Coastal erosion at Rosslare harbour, Co. Wexford, has been a problem for many years.  The erosion at Rosslare is mainly due to human interference with the natural sediment patterns in Rosslare Bay.  From a variety of historical records, a detailed account of the influence of these activities on coastal change has been established and measures have now been enacted to prevent further erosion of the coastline.</p>

	    <li><b>Land Reclamation</b>
	      <p>Between 1845 and 1855, approximated 2319 acres of north slobs in Wexford harbour and 2293 acres of the south slobs were reclaimed.  This resulted in a 50% decrease in the inter-tidal area in the harbour and a 10% reduction in tidal volume.  This resulted in changes in the pattern of sediment deposition at the entrance to the harbour and a failure and recession of 3.5 km of sand spit at the entrance of the harbour with accompanying large scale recession of the shore-line at the northern end of the strand</p></li>
	    <li><b>Construction of Rosslare Harbour</b>
	      <p>Construction of Rosslare harbour in the late 1860s interrupted the natural along-shore movement of sediment.  To accommodate this, at construction, a viaduct connecting an offshore pier to the shore was provided.  However, the shelter offered by the pier resulted in sediment settling at the lee of the pier which then required a programme of dredging.  Between, 1913 and 1960, 1.2 * 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of dredge material was dumped offshore and lost to the coastal system.  From 1964 to 1978, 425,371 m<sup>3</sup> of this material was dumped off Rosslare strand as beach re-nourishment.  In 1978, the viaduct was closed thus eliminating the maintenance dredging requirements.  The new harbour configuration now acted as a large groyn trapping large quantities of sediment on the updrift side and any sand bypassing of the harbour results in the material being pushed offshore and lost to the coastal system.</p>
	    </li>
	    <p>As a result, of these developments, beach erosion along Rosslare strand has resulted in a reduction of beach area and damage to properties and infrastructure backing the beach.  For example, a Fort, village and lifeboat station were abandoned in the 1920s because the spit at Rosslare was cut back</p>
	    <p>In order to offset these detrimental effects, a 'hold-the-line policy was adopted.  In 1957, the OPW constructed timber groynes and breastworks along the Strand and these works succeeded in slowing down erosion.  However, this success led to a reduction in sediments available for natural alongshore drift and this reduction in available sediment in combination with the vertical nature of the timber groynes and breastworks, which reflected wave energy, resulted in lowering of the beach level.  Moreover, the cost of maintaining the groynes was spiralling out of control.  Following extensive studies, rock groynes were constructed to slow down littoral drift of beach sediment due to wave action.  Beach sediment was trapped at the updrift side of the groynes, resulting in a widening of the beach.  However, at the downdrift side, due to a reduction in sediment passing of the groyne, some local erosion occurs.  However, following construction of the groynes, the groyne bays were nourished.</p>

	  <p>Balalt Strand situated in Donegal Bay and to the south of Donegal Town.  The Strand consists mainly of sandy beach with dunes backing most of it's length.  Being situated in Donegal Bay, it is offered some protection.  However, the beach is still subject to high energy waves and storm impacts and has a broad low-angle energy dissipative profile typical of beaches that are adjusted to high energy swell and storm wave impact.</p>
	  <div class="picture right">
	    <img src="http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/22rossnowlagh.jpg">
	<br></br>
	  </div>
	  <p>The beach at Balalt Strand was originally back ed by sand dunes for most of its length.  Accretion and sand advance took place between 1836 and 1907 and this was followed by a period of stability, since then, the dominant feature has been progressive erosion.  The central section of the dune front has been eroding at rates of up to 0.6m/year for the last 60 years while the southern and northern ends are eroding at a lesser rate.  From 1972 on, several parts of the dune front have been armoured and erosion has ceased in these areas while erosion continues between the armoured areas.  The Northern part of the beach with till shores showed little change between 1951 and 1977 but considerable retreat thereafter.</p>
	  <p>Both natural erosion and human interference have been identified for being responsible for the retreat.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Similar to virtually all Donegal systems, natural processes contributing to retreat include sea level rise, Atlantic storminess and sand scarcity.  Natural processes and attempting to move the Rossnowlagh beach and dunes further east.</li>
	    <li>Human induced factors include the progressive removal of the cobble storm beach, primarily for building purposes, that lies between the dunes and the beach.  Asa result, storm ridge created by the cobbles is less capable of dissipating wave energy.  Furthermore, due to pressure from recreation, the variation of species in the dune system is lessened and the natural resilience of the dune and beach system is threatened.The armour which protects the dune front has resulted in wave reflection and subsequent scouring of the beach by removing sand.  This is a serious threat where the flat to concave beach profile and the absence of sand accumulation structures suggest that sand supply is limited</p>

Error bars show 90% confidence intervals <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</figcaption></figure> 
    
	<h4>Sea Level Rise</h4> 
    
	
    
	<p>Sea level rise is primarily a result of increasing global temperatures which causes thermal expansion of the oceans (warmer water is less dense than colder water) and the loss of land-based ice (e.g. glaciers and ice sheets, permafrost).  In addition, relative sea level rise is determined by isostatic glacial adjustment.  This refers to the phenomenon of how the earth readjusts to a stable shape after its loading by ice sheets.  For example, during the last glaciation which lasted approximately 100,000 to 8,000 years before present, wide areas of the earth, including Ireland, were covered by ice sheets extending over thousands of kilometres with thicknesses of up to 4km.  These loads depressed the earth's surface down vertically by hundreds of meters.  Once these ice sheets had melted away, the earth's surface rebounded.  However, due to the properties of the earth's mantle, this rebound occurs rather slowly and is an ongoing process.  As a result, the altitude of the earth's surface is not fixed and relative sea level (RSL) rise is determined by not only sea level rise but also also by isostatic-glacial adjustment (land subsidence or uplift).  Moreover, and amongst others, globally, spatial variations in relative sea level are determined by spatial variations in sea surface heating and ocean circulation.</p>   
     
	<p>Globally, sea level rise has risen by an average of 1.7 mm per year through the 20th century.  However, for the period 1993 to 2012, a significant increase in the rate global of sea level rise has been observed with  satellite measurements indicating an average rise of 3.18 mm per year <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  </p>  
	
	
	
	<p>For Ireland, long term observational data from tide gauges which provide measurements of sea level relative to the land are deficient to make accurate estimates of sea level rise.  However, satellite observations suggest that the sea level around Ireland has increased by 2-3 mm per year since the early 1990s .  In addition to measurements from Ireland, an extensive network of tide gauges situated around the UK provide supporting evidence of these changes.  Analysis of these data indicate a mean sea level rise of 1.7 mm per year since 1916.  This rise has been attributed to climate related changes and are thought indicative of the situation to the south of Ireland <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>. </p>

	<img src="/img/slr-ireland-satellite.png" class="big"><figcaption>Based on satellite data, trends in absolute sea level rise across Europe (1992-2011) <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h4>Storm Surge</h4>
	<p>Storm surges can be defined as the difference between predicted and observed still water levels, generally measured at high tide.  Ireland lies in the path of the northerly North Atlantic storm tracks.  These storms affect all of Ireland's coast to some extent with southern and western coasts being particularly susceptible.  Wave climate of the Irish Sea is generally dominated by inputs from the Atlantic Ocean via St. Georges Channel.  Storm surges in the Irish sea are generally associated with the movement of major Atlantic depressions over the Irish sea basin and extreme 50-year surge heights are approximately 1-1.5m on the Irish Coast <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</p>
    
	<p>The observational record for the Northeast Atlantic and the area around Ireland, indicate that the total number of storms has decreased slightly over the period 1965 - 1995.  However, storms are now concentrated in the winter and the intensity of these storms has increased.  In contrast, summers have tended to be calmer <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>
	Due to a limited understanding of some of the important effects driving sea level rise, a best estimate for the upper bounds of sea level rise cannot be provided.  According to the IPCC, projected global sea level rise for the period to 2100 are in the range of 0.09-0.88 m with a mean figure from all climate models of 0.48 m <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  However, due to a limited understanding of some of the important effects which are driving sea level rise, e.g. melting of the polar ice caps, a best estimate or future upper bound for sea level rise cannot be provided with confidence and estimates of up to 4m and 6m above current levels have been suggested by some models <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.
    </p>
	
	
	
    <p>
	When examining the impacts of projected rates of sea level rise for Ireland, the effect of isostatic rebound and topography is of importance.</p> 
	
	<p>Spatial variations in rates of isostatic rebound rates for Ireland are a result of the location of main ice sheet where the maximum weight was concentrated.  In Ireland, the ice sheet was centred in the north and as a result, in these areas the greatest depression of land took place.  South of a line from Galway to Dublin, isostatic rebound is slight while to the north, the land is continuing to rise <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</p>  
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:left">
	<img src="/img/isostatic-rebound-ireland.jpg"><figcaption>Rates of crustal movement modelled for Ireland over the last 4,000 years.  Positive values indicate uplift, while negative values indicate subsidence. <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span></figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Topographic variation is also a key factor and there is a high degree of topographical variation between the Atlantic and Irish sea coasts.  The Atlantic coastline is characterised by high cliff coastlines interspersed with bays.  This rock-dominated coast characterise the southwestern, western and northwestern coastal regions of Ireland.  In contrast, the Irish sea coast is low-lying with non-consolidated sediments and glacial tills and sea level rise is already having an impact on these areas through erosion.  The west and south display vulnerability to sea level rise at low-lying bays and estuaries, such as Cork harbour, Clew Bay, Tralee Bay and the Shannon estuary.</p>  
	
	<p>On this basis, combining sea level rise with isostatic adjustment, projected rates of sea level rise vary substantially.  Areas of the extreme southwest, from the Dingle Peninsula to Cape Clear, are likely to experience the largest increases at a rate of 3.3-4.8 mm per year while for areas of the north east coast are likely to experience a rate of 2.2-3.7 mm per year <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>. As a result, areas of the south will likely feel the affects of sea level rise first, particularly low-lying coastal locations situated on soft or easily eroded materials and coastal floodplains.   In addition, projected changes in sea levels are expected to enlarge the horizontal and vertical extent of estuaries.  This will result in the penetration of tides further upstream and would impede the flow of rivers and result in estuarine flooding.</p>
      
    <p>
	Due to Ireland's location in the west of Europe, exposure to Atlantic storms is of concern and this is particularly the case in the context of rising sea levels.  According to the IPCC, there is likely to be an increase in the number of intense cyclones and associated strong winds, particularly over the North Atlantic.  These changes will have a direct impact on storm surges and rising sea levels will enhance the impacts of storm surges <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  
	</p>
	<p>
	For Ireland and when compared with the 1961-1900 period, models indicate that for the period 2031-2060, storm surge heights in the range of 50 -100 cm will increase in frequency around all Irish coastal areas with the exception of the south and by up to 20% in the north and west.  There is also an increase in extreme storm surge heights along the west and east coasts, with most of the extreme surges occurring in winter <span class="reference">[8]</span>.  As a result, when combined with projected increases in coastal storms in winter, sea level rise may result in inundation of coastal areas and this could have major economic, social and environmental implications as all Ireland's major cities are located on the coast.</p>
      
    <h4>Projected Inundation</h4>
    <p>
	Not taking into account the existence of coastal defences of isostatic-glacial adjustment, under a projected sea level rise of 0.5 m, it is estimated that 200 km<sup>2</sup> of land area in the Republic of Ireland is at risk of inundation and this is particularly the case for low lying areas of the Irish coast.  The counties most at risk under a sea level rise of 0.5 m are Wexford, Kerry and Cork.  However, in terms of relative land vulnerabilities, Dublin, Louth and Weford are at highest risk .  Under a projected sea level rise of 6m, it is estimated that close to 1200 km<sup>2</sup> of land area would be at risk <span class="reference"><a href="#9">[9]</a></span>.</p>  
	
	<p>Of more immediate concern for Ireland is the impacts of storm surge superimposed on relative sea level rise.  On the basis of a sea level rise of 0.48m coupled with an extreme surge of 2.6 m, representing a 1-in-100 year event on the east coast and a 1-in-12 year event on the west coast <span class="reference"><a href="#10">[10]</a></span>,  it is estimated that approximately 600 km<sup>2</sup> of land would be at risk of inundation <span class="reference"><a href="#11">[11]</a></span>.  While the current return period for such an event is lower on the east than the west coast, an increase in frequency for such events is projected for both coasts and indicates that a substantial amount of land could be inundated on a more regular basis.  For example, the current 1-in-100 year event is likely to become a 1-in-10 year event or less <span class="reference"><a href="12">[12]</a></span>.</p>
    </p>
 
    <p>
	Sea level rise presents itself as a serious problem where infrastructure is at risk.  Ireland's major cities all lie on the coast and these will be at particular risk as impacts may be enhanced due to the inability of the shoreline to adjust naturally to a change in sea level.  Moreover, flooding of urban areas can last much longer depending on the ability of the area to drain excess flood waters.  Projected   
	
	Moreover, when major urban areas are located on the coast and subject  to inundation, disruption to transport and communication can affect the entire country for weeks after the event.</p>

Those cities most at risk are Galway, Limerick and Dublin <span class="reference"><a href="#13">[13]</a></span>.</figcaption>

	<h3>Implications for Management</h3>
    
	<p>Coastal flooding currently constitutes a threat to Ireland and this threat is projected to increase in the future as a result of climate change-induced sea level and storm surge.  Areas that are currently at risk of flooding will be at greater risk while new areas previously not at risk may be at increased risk due climate change.</p>  
	
	<p>Due to the uncertainties surrounding projections of sea level rise and storm surges, a new approach is required for coastal protection.  Traditional hard engineering structures, such as sea walls may still be needed where settlements or infrastructure are threatened by the sea but in other areas, where land is less valuable, the policy should be of accomadating and adjusting.  Moreover, approaches which serve to preserve or protect the shoreline may not be optimal in the long-term and a more effective approach may be to manage change in the coastal zone so as it is allowed to adjust to environmenatal changes.  This requires a high level of understanding of the coastal system supported by effective monitoring of vulnerable locations to identify where and when remedial action may be necessary</p>  
	
	<p>In the short-term, a number of measures might be taken:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Current areas at risk of flooding should be immediately identified and development in these areas should be stopped;</li>
	<li>Adopting a precautionary approach, areas at risk of future flooding should be identified and development in these areas restricted.  This might be achieved through the designation of a set back area from the shoreline on which development would restricted;</li>
	<li>Coastal innundation hot spots should be identified, i.e. areas where high economic losses might be realised under projected changes in sea level;</li>
	<li>Natural coastal defenses should be identified, e.g. salt marshes, and development restricted in these areas.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In the medium to long-term:</li>
	<li>Due to uncertainties associated with projected sea level rise, planned coastal defences should be flexible and assessed against the full range of climate scenarios;</li>
	<li>Local actions to reduce vulnerability should be assessed against the larger spatial and temporal context of coastal dynamics, e.g. sediment budget, so as not to initiate or erosion further along the shore.</li>

	<h3>Flooding of Dublin February 2002</h3>
	<div class="picture right">
	<img src="http://www.mccip.org.uk/media/3993/coastal-graph.gif"></br>

	</div>
	<p>On February 1st 2002, a spring tide coincided with a low pressure system in the Atlantic which generated conditions that propagated into the Irish sea in the form of a surge wave.  This combined with strong southwesterly winds lead to an extreme water level of 5.46 m being recorded at Dublin Port.  This is the highest annual extreme high water level ever recorded for Dublin Port since records began in 1923.</p>  
	<p>For the 1st of February, a high tide had been expected and an examination of tidal levels indicate that the actual tidal range of 2.2 m was not unusual and on its own would not have caused flooding of Dublin.  However, with the added impacts due to storm surge a tide of 2.95 mOD led to overtopping of coastal defences, lasting for approximately 2.5 hours, and resulted extensive flooding throughout parts of Dublin and Fingal.  Moreover, Around Dublin, the tidal flooding also caused an increase in water levels in rivers, the rivers Liffey, Dodder, Tolka and Royal Canal all burst their banks.  As a result of this flooding, it is estimated that over 300 people were directly affected and required re-housing as a consequence of the flood damage</p>

      <h2>Inland Flooding</h2>
      <div id="key-info">
	Ireland has been subject to a number of major flood events around the country over the last decade and climate change is likely to result in increased flood risk.   However, there still remain large uncertainties in projections of future precipitation for Ireland and these uncertainties are exacerbated when employed in projecting hydrological response to climate change.  Nonetheless, projections for Ireland indicate an increased level of flood risk during the winter months.  Areas already at risk of flooding can be expected to be at increased flood risk while areas currently not prone to flood risk may become more prone to flooding in the future.  This is particularly the case for those areas located at the confluence of major rivers.

	<h3>Inland Flooding</h3>
	<p>
	Inland flooding is a function of rates of precipitation and evaporation and also catchment characteristics which determine levels of surface and/or groundwater runoff.  Catchment characteristics such as soil type, infiltration and porosity all determine response to precipitation. In addition to the basic hydrological parameters, human activities such as the development of land and infrastructure interventions (e.g. reservoirs and flood defences) also affect flood hazard.  Importantly, for some areas, flood defences that have been built according to design standards based on the probability of floods in the current climate may be at risk of failure under future conditions.
      </p>
	 
	<a id="current-flood-risk"></a>
	<h3>Current Flood Risk</h3></a>
     <p>Inland flooding in Ireland is quite widespread. Over the recent past, flood risk has been exacerbated through the new development of lands.  For example, development on flood plains has altered flow routes and the volume available for flood storage.  Moreover, change in land management and introducing surfaces with reduced permeability, such as roads, roofs and carparks has resulted in decreased absorption capacity and increased runoff rates.  Flooding can also arise from the failure of infrastructure designed to store or carry water or to protect an area against flooding.  As a result, existing flood defences which have been designed based on past flood events must now be re-appraised in the context of climate change.</p> 
	 
	 <p>For more information on areas flooded in the past, the <a href="http://www.floodmaps.ie" target="_blank"> National Flood Hazard Mapping website </a> developed by Office of Public Works provides information on previous flood events while the <a href="http://www.cfram.ie/pfra/" target="_blank">Draft Provisional Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA)</a>, also developed by the OPW provides indicative maps of areas deemed to be at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and estuaries.  Please note that The draft PFRA is only a preliminary assessment, based on available data or readily derivable information and is purely indicative.</p>
	 
	 <figure style="float:right; clear:left">
	<img src="/img/FR-2010.jpg"><figcaption>Based on data collected in 2010, this map identifies communities  deemed at significant flood risk (Benn et al. 2010).</figcaption>
      </figure>
	  
    <a id="projected-flood-risk"></a>
	<h3>Projected variations in Flood Risk for Ireland</h3>

    <p>
	Long-term records of riverflow for Ireland indicate an increasing trend for all seasons and this is particularly the case for annual and winter high flows <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Projected climatic data for Ireland would indicate that this trend will continue.  Climate change projections of precipitation for Ireland indicate changes in both the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation and these changes will have a direct effect on flood risk.  
	</p>
    
	<p>
	The key projections produced for Ireland exhibit differences in the extent and spatial distributions of  projected precipitation and this is reflecting the relatively high degree of uncertainty in these projections. However, there is agreement in the overall direction of change.  Projections indicate that precipitation will become increasingly seasonal with winter becoming significantly wetter by the mid to late 20th century and summers drier .  Moreover, the occurrence of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</p>  
    
	<p>
	In order to assess how climate change will affect the frequency and magnitude of inland flooding, projected climate data is employed to drive hydrological models that have been developed/parameterized for specific catchments. However, the employment of hydrological models amplifies the already considerable uncertainty implicit to climate modeling.  Nonetheless, projected changes in hydrological regimes have been developed for a wide range of catchments in Ireland and a number of consistent signals for changes in hydrological regimes most prominently driven by changes in precipitation patterns are apparent <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</p>
      
    <p>Overall, modelling results indicate that increased precipitation will result in substantial increases in winter and spring stream flow for all of the catchments assessed and, as a result, an elevated risk of flooding. For winter, and by the mid to late century, an increase of up to 20% in the amount of water flowing in rivers can be expected with the greatest increases in January February.     
	</p>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:left">

Grey bars show levels of uncertainty in rainfall-runoff model with the mean shown as a black dashed line <span class="reference"<a href="#5">[5]</a></span></figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>In addition, and of importance in the case of flood risk management, modelling results also indicate that the occurrence of extreme flood events will increase and that the impact of climate change on flood behaviour is higher for low frequency events (floods with a return period of 100 years) than for high frequency events (floods with return periods of 5 years)<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.  For example, for the Blackwater, it is projected that by mid-century, the current 40 year return period is likely to be associated with a 9 year recurrence interval <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  A recent Europe wide study indicates that flood events that currently have a return period of once in a hundred years will increase for Ireland's major rivers as the century progresses <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</p>

	<h3>Implications for Flood Management</h3>

    <p>
	The increase in magnitude and frequency of flood events would suggest significant impacts for areas already at risk of flooding.     In addition, the magnitude of projected changes would indicate that areas currently not prone to flood risk may become more prone to flooding in the future.  This is particularly the case for those areas located at the confluence of major rivers or those areas located around estuaries where increased sea level rise in combination with increased river outflow may cause extensive estuarine flooding.  These changes raise concerns regarding the integrity of flood defences, the capacity of the urban drainage system, the need for greater concerning planning and development of vulnerable areas as well as insurance implications for commercial and private properties.</p>
	
	<p>
	In the short term, a number of measures may be taken that are both flexible and robust:
	</p>
	<li>Inappropriate development should be prohibited in areas that are at high risk of flooding, e.g. flood plains or areas that area already prone to flooding.</li>
	<li>Areas at risk of future flooding should be delineated and suitable guidance should be provided</li>
	
	<p>
	In the medium to long term, and as fixed design standards are no longer relevant:
	</p>
	<li>Existing flood protection schemes and water infrastructure should be assessed against the full range of climate scenarios.</li>
	<li>Planned flood protection schemes and all water infrastructure projects, e.g. drainage schemes, should be assessed against the full range of climate scenarios and should be flexible so as they can be adapted in the future as more information becomes available.</li>

    <h2>Water Scarcity</h2>
    <div id="key-info">
     <p>Currently, Ireland has one of the highest rates of water availability in Europe.  However, regional water shortages do occur at certain times of the year and this is because the places where water availability is greatest and where water is most needed tends to be at opposite sides of the country.   Projections indicate an overall decrease in levels of precipitation during the summer months and this will lead to significant decreases in annual effective runoff and the availability of water supply for all sectors.  Moreover, it is in some of the areas where demand is greatest, e.g. the Dublin region, that the greatest decreases are expected and this may make the provision of potable water problematic, during the summer months in particular.</p>

	<a id="availability-water-supply"></a>
	<h3>Availability of Water supply</h3>
	<p>
     Availability of fresh water through surface and groundwater flows is determined by the seasonality of precipitation and evapotranspiration, as well as by catchment characteristics such as geology, soils and landcover which determine levels of storage.  The amount of water stored in lakes, as groundwater and as soil moisture changes through time in response to changes in rainfall inputs and losses through evapotranspiration.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns modify the annual water budget of river basins as well as the timing and seasonality of river flows and groundwater interactions.  As a result, a changing climate may have potentially detrimental impacts on Ireland's fresh water resources.  </p>  
	  
	 <p>
	 In addition to projected changes in climate, the characteristics of water supply systems and the main drivers of demand (including population growth and development) will also have a strong bearing on vulnerability to climate change.  For a water supply system with large excess capacity (a resilient water supply system), a large change in climate may have little effect.  However, and in contrast, for a water supply system with little excess capacity and that is operating at, or close to capacity, even a small change in climate can have a large effect and may tip the system past a critical threshold where demand for water exceeds supply.

	<h3>The current water supply situation</h3>
	<p>
	In Ireland, water resources are dominated by surface waters (81.9%), while the remainder originates from groundwaters (10.5%), these resources are located primarily in the east and southeast of the country, and springs (7.6%) <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Increased levels of demand come primarily from the industrial and domestic sectors with domestic demand increasing primarily due to population growth and increasing water consumption per capita.</p>  
	
	<p>Levels of precipitation are highest in the west of the country which receives on average 1,000-1,300 mm per year and over 2,000 mm per year in many mountainous areas compared to 750-1000 mm of yearly rainfall in the east.  This is in contrast to population density which shows the highest levels of population in the east of Ireland.  The water required to meet this demand is largely sourced from freshwater resources situated in the Wicklow mountains.</p>
	
	<p> Currently in Ireland, there is little excess capacity/headroom in meeting water demand.  For example, in the Dublin Region, it is expected that demand will outstrip supply by 2022 at the latest.  Moreover, in 2008, the national average for level of unaccounted for water was 43% and this is thought to be due to, amongst others, the antiquity of the system, with some parts of the water supply system dating to the Victorian era, breakages, and the failure of building inspection regimes aimed at ensuring that housing estates built in the last 10 years comply with building regulations <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>. As a result, the resilience of the water supply system is already under threat and for areas that currently experience the greatest level of demand, e.g. the eastern seaboard, and where the most rapid increase in demand can be expected due to population growth, the identification and development of new supplies is required and this is regardless of any effects that climate change might have.</p> 
	
	
	
	<a id="projected-supply"></a>
	<h3>Projected Changes in water supply</h3>
	<p>In projecting changes in water supply, hydrological models for sepcific catchments are driven by projected changes in climate. As a result, there is a relatively high degree of uncertainty associated with projected changes in water supply.  Nonetheless, there is a relatively high degree of confidence in temporal variations in changes in hydrological regimes for analysed catchments.</p>
	
	<p>Consistently, projections for a number of selected catchments in Ireland indicate substantial decreases in streamflow for surface water dominated catchments during the summer months and this is particularly the case for those catchments located in the east of the country<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="4">[4]</a></span>.  For example, significant reductions have been projected for the Boyne by the 2020s in early summer and autumn with reductions becoming more pronounced as the century progresses with 70% reductions projected for August by the end of the century <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  However, it is thought that reductions during summer will not be as substantial for ground water dominated catchments due to the sustaining nature of baseflows <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  However, climate change does have significant implications for aquifer levels as decreases in precipitation during the summer and autumn months will result in a delay to the seasonal recharge of aquifers.  Given that the variability of precipitation may increase, a year with below average winter and spring precipitation could result in a severe groundwater deficit.  While there is good agreement in available modelling results for summer simulations, disparities do exist in relation to autumn changes with some simulations indicating that reductions will continue well into the Autumn months<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span> and others not<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  This is most likely due to the differences in rainfall scenarions employed aswell as in the structures and processes represented by the rainfall-runoff models employed.</p>   
	
	<p>Projected decreases in supply are expected to coincide with periods of increasing demand due to non-climatic drivers such as population growth.  For example, when compared the levels of popoulation in 2010, Ireland's population is projected to increase by 46.5% by 2060, the strongest population growth rate of any European country <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  Moreover, projected increases in temperature are expected to result in increased water demand during the summer months due to higher tempertures.  For example, reductions in soil moisture during the summer and Autumn months may mean that irrigation is required to sustain crops, including pasture.  At present, the agricultural sector accounts for 10% of water use in Ireland.</p>
    
	<p>There is a high degree of confidence in projections of temporal variations in precipitation.  However, the spatial distribution is less certain and the actual location of future water resources remains unclear and further work is required to reduce the uncertainty in spatial variations in future precipitation.  Nonetheless, current projections indicate that the west of Ireland will become wetter and this would suggest that future significant water resources will be located in the west.</p>
   
    <p>A widespread reduction in runoff resulting in the increased frequency and duration of flows will also lead to water quality problems as many rivers would not have sufficient capacity to dilute effluent discharged into them.  Moreover, under projected increases in population, the quantity of discharge will likely increase.   Projected increases in the occurrence of extreme events will also have a detrimental impact on water quality and will affect the availability of potable water.  This is due to increased levels of runoff and associated contaminants to watercourses.
    </p>
	
	<a id="implications-for-management"></a>
	<h3>Implications for Mangement of Water Resources</h3>
	
	<p>To date the water supply system has remained resilient to current climate variability but this cannot be taken for granted as exemplified by water shortages due to floods and cold weather  during recent years.  Future changes in climate will have substantial implications for the availability of surface waters and will have implications for both water supply and quality and will result in a reduction in the reliability and resilience and an increase in the vulnerability of water supply.  Although the exact nature of these changes remain uncertain, evidence indicates substantial decreases in levels of surface water during the summer months and this is particularly the case for the east of Ireland.  However, it must also be recognised that climatic change is not the only pressure on water resources and levels of demand due to population growth and development may also be problematic.  This is because currently for large parts of Ireland, the water supply system is currently operating at or close to capacity.</p>
	
	<p>
	In the near term, many elements of adaptation planning can be identified that are robust to uncertainty and flexible.  These strategies should form and important aspect of adaptation planning. 
	</p>
	<li>
	Detection of water loses and leakage control should be a priority in order to reduce leakage to acceptable levels.  All water authorities should set targets to be achieved in specified time periods.
	</li>
	<li>
	Currently, levels of water usage in Ireland are significantly higher than elsewhere in Europe.  Climate change and a growing population could lead to significant water shortages in the medium to long term.  As a result, measures to reduce demand should be implemented.
	</li>
	
	<p>In the medium to long term, a range of measures can be identified that are also robust to climate change:</p>
	<li>
	Climate, demographic and economic change will alter the needs and demands of water users in Ireland and, as a result, the abstration of water represents a threat to water availability.  In order to effectively manage competing needs, the volume, location, by whom and for what purpose water is being abstracted needs to be examined.
	</li>
	<li>Water infrastructure represents long-term assets.  Where investment in new infrastructure is required, these infrastructure should be subjected to a full sensitivity analysis of performance under a full range of uncertainty associated with climate change.

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>In order to get started in developing your adaptation plan, you should first consider why you want to adapt to climate change given other challenges.</p>
  
  <p>
  It is know well known that climate change is occurring and that regardless of attempts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the impacts of climate change are inevitable in the short to medium term.
  </p>
  
  <p>In order to facilitate you in developing your adaptation plan, we have developed a workbook on which you can record information of import for the development of your plan.  You can download a copy of this workbook <a href="/tools/current_vulnerability.xlsx">here</a>. 
  
  <h3>i. Assemble your team</h3>
  
  <p>Climate change will impact upon a wide range of stakeholders and the successful implementation of adaptation policies requires coherent and integrated responses.  As a result, cross-sectoral dialogue and actions are required and the identfication of all relevant stakeholders is a crucial step in developing an adaptation plan.</p>
 
  <h3>ii. Define adaptation objectives and constraints</p>
  
  <p>As is the case with any decision context, a crucial first step is the identification of relevant objectives and constraints.  In order to ensure that the risks and constraints identified in subsequent steps in the analysis are examined in the context of a set of pre-defined onjectives and constraints.  Relevant objectives need not be adaptation specific an employing broader objectives can be useful in mainstreaming adaptation decision making process.  It is also important that relevant constraints on action are identified and the include economic, political, geographical and environmental constraints.</p>
  
  <div id="text-box">
  <h4>Examples of objectives might include:</h4>
  <ul class="small-indent">
  <li>To provide a plan to manage flood risk over the next 100 years;</li>
  <li>To ensure that biodiversity and ecosystems meet the requirements of environmental legislation until 2020;</li> 
  <li>To ensure water supply meets a defined level of service over a planning period, in a way that is cost effective and compatible with environmental regulations.</li>
  </div>
  
  <div id="text-box">
  <h4>Examples of constraints might include:</h4>
  <ul class="small-indent">
  <li></li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>Due to the fact that climate change will impact upon a wide range of stakeholders at sectoral, local, regional and national levels, the process of identifying adaptation objectives may not be a simple task, particularly where a large number of stkeholders are involved, as there are a number of difficult and often complex trade offs to be made between management objectives and the means by which tehy might be achieved.</p>

  <h2>Structure the Problem</h2>
 <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Climate change presents different challenges for differing sectors and geographic areas, ecosystems and populations.  Moreover, the effects of climate change are spatially heterogenous and require place-based locally-specific repsonses.</p>  

<p>In developing an understanding of how climate change might affect you, coming to an understanding of  your exposure to climate change, the sensitivity of your particular sector, geographic area, ecosystem and/or populations, and therefore the consequential impacts of climate change is a fundamental starting point.</p>  

<p>This step in the tool will facilitate you in identifying your current climate vulnerabilities and following from this, examine how these might change under expected climatic changes.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"> 
	<img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg"/> <figcaption>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the effects of a climate hazard.  Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</figcaption></figure>

<h3>i. Current vulnerability</h3>
	
<p>In addition to creating new novel and future problems, climate change is also expected to exacerbate the existing vulnerabilities of most sectors and geographic areas.</p>  

<p>As a first step in examining the effects of climate change on a particular area or sector, and with respect to near-term decision making, rather than projections of impact many decades hence, the present is seen as the essential starting point.</p>  

<blockquote>Those locations currently most affected by weather-related factors are also likely to be those most impacted upon by climate change (IPCC, 2007b).  It is also thought that adaptation to short term climate variability and extreme events will reduce vulnerability to longer-term climatic change (IPCC, 2012).</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to examine how current climatic variability and extremes affect you, an examination of previous weather events, their impacts, consequences and actions taken will allow you determine your sensitivity to current weather conditions.<p>

<p>To get started, and in collaboration with colleagues:</p>
<ul class="small-indent">
<li>Don't assume that weather and climate don't affect you as vulnerability can often be hidden within an organisation or managed or tolerated to mask the affects.</li> 
<li>Think about average climate, such as seasonal temperature and rainfall currently affect you;</li>  
<li>Consider the effects of extreme weather events and how these affected you;</li>  
</ul>

<blockquote>In order to help you identify how weather and climate affect you.  It can be helpful to adopt a systems approach and examine your system as a whole and how the effects of weather events cascade through your system/area of interest.  <a href="http://www.climateireland.ie/iasess/login">The Climate Impact and Scoping Tool</a> made available through Climate Ireland will help in this analysis and identify how weather and climate effect you and how these effects cascade through your system.</blockquote> 

<div id="text-box">
<p>Once you have considered how weather and climate currently affect you, assemble a profile of your vulnerability to current weather:</p>

<ul class="small-indent">
<li>Describe past weather events</li>
<li>Identify the consequences of these weather events for you, quantify as much as possible</li>
<li>Identify any critical thresholds that were exceeded as a consequence</li>
<li>Describe responses that were put in place and assess their effectiveness</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This profile will provide a basis for examining how future changes in climate might affect you and the consequences of these changes.</p>

<h3>ii. Future Vulnerability</h3>

<p>Once you have established how climate and weather currently affect you, an assessment of how expected and future change can be undertaken.</p>

<p>In characterising future climate risk, a hierarchal/tiered risk assessment is employed and provides a means of staggering the data gathering in order to tailor the demands to a given decision context.</p>
  
<blockquote>Essentially, a hierarchal risk assessment begins with an examination of broadscale qualitative information and builds to a more detailed analysis where and when required.</blockquote>

<p>As a a first step in this assessment, and in combination with an understanding of historical vulnerability, an examination of broadscale climate projection information can be undertaken.</p>  

<blockquote>This involves a scoping exercise whereby you can begin to identify the extent to which the opportunities and risks presented by climate change might be important to your system or area of interest and allow you to identify areas where adaptation might be required.</blockquote>

<p>Broadscale qualitative climatic information can be employed and is available <a href="/ci/climate-change/projections-ireland" target="blank"> here</a>.  On the basis of these projections, begin to assess how these future changes might exacerbate/alleviate existing vulnerabilities to climate identified through step i.  In addition, climate change is also expected to create new risks and opportunities, on the basis of broadscale climate projection information, identify any additional risks or opportunities that climate change might offer.</p>
		
<div id="text-box">
<p>Once you have fully considered how future climate change might affect existing vulnerabilities and create new risks and opportunities, assemble this information according to:</p>
<li>Projected climate change;</li>
<li>Projected impact and consequence;</li>
<li>Level of certainty associated with the projected change;</li>
<li>Effectiveness of existing coping strategies;</li>

  <h2>Assess Your Options</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Once you have identified existing and potential future vulnerabilities to climate change, you can then assess available adaptation options.  This step will facilitate you in identifying and characterising available adaptation options.</p>  
  
  <p>Adaptation options are generally classified as 'grey', 'green' and 'soft'.  'Grey' options refer to tecengineering solutions, e.g. the construction of coastal defences.  'Green' options refer to ecosystem approaches that employ the services of nature while 'soft' options refer to managerial, legal and policy approaches that alter human behaviour and styles of governance.  'Green' and 'soft' options typically aim to increase adaptive capacity, are often less resource intensive and generally provide multiple benefits.</p>   
  
  <p>The three options can generally be further categorised according to extent to which they are justifiable under different climatr
