      <h2>Coastal Erosion</h2>
      <div id="text-box">
	<p>Approximately 20% of Ireland's coast is at risk of coastal erosion <span class="reference">[1]</span>.  Sea level rise combined with an increase in the severity of coastal storms is expected to exacerbate these problems.</p>

	</div>
      <p>Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon which has shaped our coastal landscapes and is the process whereby the coastline is worn away by the sea through wave actions and tidal currents. Coastal erosion also provides terrestrial sediment to the coastal system and deposits these in areas of aggradation which include beaches, dunes, reefs, mudflats and marshes.  These systems then provide a range of functions including absorption of wave energies, nesting and hatching fauna, protection of freshwater or location for recreational activities.</p> 
      
      <p>Waves are the most important erosive agent, their effect on rates of erosion varies with wave energy and characteristics and also the nature of the material exposed to wave attack.  For example where a coast is formed by steep cliffs which plunge straight into deep water, waves are not forced to break before they impact and as a result, waves are reflected with little loss of energy and rarely cause erosion.  In contrast, for coastlines that are more commonly associated with breaking waves, a considerable amount of kinetic energy is displaced as they break on the shoreline.  Breaking waves, plunging breakers in particular, through the combined effect of air compression and the impact of a considerable mass of water will dislodge loose particles and fractured rock.  Breaking waves may also throw particles against the shore and this can lead to the abrasion of shoreline material. Once eroded, coastlines may stabilise but the lost sediment can never be replaced.</p>

      <p>Once eroded, materials are transported along the coast by waves.  This movement is called long-shore drift and occurs when waves move materials towards the coast at an angle.  Due to gravity, the backwash from the waves then carries the material back from the coast at right angles.  As a result, eroded materials are moved slowly along the coast.  Where there is an obstruction to long-shore drift (e.g. spit), or the power of the waves is reduced, deposition occurs.</p>
      
      <p>Increasingly, human influence (urbanisation and economic activities) in the coastal zone has turned coastal erosion from a natural phenomena into a problem of increasing intensity.  Human-induced factors of particular concern are the construction of hard-coastal defences which include seawalls, dykes, breakwaters, jetties or any other structures which aim to protect assets landward of the coastline.  These constructions can exacerbate the problem of coastal erosion by impacting upon coastal processes such as sediment transport and result in amongst others:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Trapping of sediment transported along shore and as a result, a sediment deficit downdrift due to fact that in contrast to natural coastlines, hard structures do not provide sediment for the alongshore drift.  Such processes are evident at Rosslare Harbour, Ireland;</li>
	<li>Incoming waves reflected by hard structures mean that wave energy is not dissipated and results in increased turbulence and cross-shore erosion;</li>
	<li>Wave diffraction occurs due to the proximity of hard structure and this results in wave energy being either diluted in some places or concentrated in others;
	</li>
	<li>Land reclamation projects undertaken in tidal bays or basins in particular result in a reduction of the tidal volume and therefore a change in the ebb and flow currents transporting sediments.  As a result, coastlines thought to be relatively stable may begin to erode;</li>
	<li>River regulation works (e.g. Damming) impact coastal processes by impacting upon sediment discharge and may results in a sediment deficit at the river mouth and subsequent sediment erosion;
	</li>
	<li>Dredging for amongst others, navigational and construction purposes affects coastal processes by removing from the foreshore material which protect the coast against erosion, by causing a sediment deficit and by modifying the water depth;</li>
	<li>Vegetation clearing, changing of landuse and landcover can decrease the resistance of areas to erosion.  This is because vegetation can provide stability to eroding cliff faces, dunes or beaches and minimizes water infiltration;</li>
	<li>Ship induced waves impacts upon natural wave climatology and wave energy provoked by ships can result in increased coastal erosion.</li>

	<b>Current erosion patterns for Ireland</b>
      </p>
      <div class="picture right"> 
	<img src="/img/eurosion_ireland.jpg"/> <br/>
      </div>
      <p>The coastline of Ireland is highly varied with differing exposures and it is currently estimated that 20% of Ireland's coastline is subject to coastal erosion.  The coasts most susceptible to coastal erosion are those composed of unconsolidated (soft) sediment comprising of glaciated debris, sandy beaches, sand and gravel barriers and sand plains (machair) <span class="reference">[2]</span>.  These areas are most common on Ireland's eastern and southern coasts and also in isolated areas, sedimentary bays, on western and northern coasts (e.g. the Shannon estuary, Donegal, Clew, Tralee and Dingle Bays).  Many of these soft coasts are low-lying, at less than 10-12 m above mean sea level and rates of erosion for these areas average 0.2-0.5 metres per year but often reach values of 1-2 metres per year.  In contrast, for the rocky shores of the south and west, land loss can be as little as 0.01 metres per century <span class="reference">[2]</span>.  The effects of this erosion are visible as:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Rapid cliff retreat;</li>
	<li>onland movement of dunes and other barriers;</li>
	<li>and on beaches, the lowering of levels with the loss of finer sediments</li>

	  <h3>Coastal Erosion at Rosslare Harbour, Co. Wexford</h3>

	  <p>Coastal erosion at Rosslare harbour, Co. Wexford, has been a problem for many years.  The erosion at Rosslare is mainly due to human interference with the natural sediment patterns in Rosslare Bay.  From a variety of historical records, a detailed account of the influence of these activities on coastal change has been established and measures have now been enacted to prevent further erosion of the coastline.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <div class="picture right">
	      <img src="/img/rosslare.png">
	</br>
	    </div>
	    <li><b>Land Reclamation</b>
	      <p>Between 1845 and 1855, approximated 2319 acres of north slobs in Wexford harbour and 2293 acres of the south slobs were reclaimed.  This resulted in a 50% decrease in the inter-tidal area in the harbour and a 10% reduction in tidal volume.  This resulted in changes in the pattern of sediment deposition at the entrance to the harbour and a failure and recession of 3.5 km of sand spit at the entrance of the harbour with accompanying large scale recession of the shore-line at the northern end of the strand</p></li>
	    <li><b>Construction of Rosslare Harbour</b>
	      <p>Construction of Rosslare harbour in the late 1860s interrupted the natural along-shore movement of sediment.  To accomadate this, at construction, a viaduct connecting an offshore pier to the shore was provided.  However, the shleter offered by the pier resulted in sediment settling at the lee of the pier which then required a programme of dredging.  Between, 1913 and 1960, 1.2 * 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of dredge material was dumped offshore and lost to the coastal system.  From 1964 to 1978, 425,371 m<sup>3</sup> of this material was dumped off Rosslare strand as beach renourishment.  In 1978, the viaduct was closed thus eliminating the maintenance dredging requirements.  The new harbour configuration now acted as a large groyn trapping large quanitities of sediment on the updrift side and any sand bypassing of the harbour results in the material being pushed offshore and lost to the coastal system.</p>
	    </li>
	    <p>As a result, of these developments, beach erosion along Rosslare strand has resulted in a reduction of beach area and damage to properties and infrastructure backing the beack.  For example, a Fort, village and lifeboat station were abandoned in the 1920s becsure the spit at Rosslare was cut back</p>
	    <p>In order to offset these detrimental effects, a 'hold-the-ine policy was adopted.  In 1957, the OPW constructed timber groynes and breastworks along the Strand and these works succeded in slowing down erosion.  However, this success led to a reduction in sediments available for natural alongshore drift and this reduction in available sediment in combination with the vertical nature of the timber groynes and breastworks, which reflected wave energy, resulted in lowering of the beach level.  Moreover, the cost of maintaining the groynes was spiralling out of control.  Following extensive studies, rock groynes were constructed to slow down littoral drift of beach sediment due to wave action.  Beach sediment was trapped at the updrift side of the groynes, resulting in a widening of the beach.  However, at the downdrift side, due to a reduction in sediment passing of the groyne, some local erosion occurs.  However, following construction of the groynes, the groyne bays were nourished.</p>

	  <h3>Coastal Erosion at Balalt Strand, Rossnowlagh, Co. Donegal</h3>

	  <p>Balalt Strand situated in Donegal Bay and to the south of Donegal Town.  The Strand consists mainly of sandy beach with dunes backing most of it's length.  Being situiated in Donegal Bay, it is offered some protection.  However, the beach is still subject to high energy waves and storm impacts and has a broad low-angle energy dissipative profile typical of beaches that are adjusted to high energy swell and storm wave impact.</p>
	  <div class="picture right">
	    <img src="http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/22rossnowlagh.jpg">
	</br>
	  </div>
	  <p>The beach at Balalt Strand was originally back ed by sand dunes for most of its length.  Accretion and sand advance took place between 1836 and 1907 and this was followed by a period of stability, since then, the dominant feature has been progressive erosion.  The central section of teh dune front has been eroding at rates of up to 0.6m/year for the last 60 years while the southern and northern ends are eroding at a lesser rate.  From 1972 on, several parts of teh dune front have been armoured and erosion has ceased in these areas while erosion continues between the armoured areas.  The Northern part of the beach with till shores showed little change between 1951 and 1977 but considerable retreat thereafter.</p>
	  <p>Both natural erosion and human interference have been identified for being responsible for the retreat.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Similar to virtually all Donegal systems, natural processes contributing to retreat include sea level rise, Atlantic storminess and sand scarcity.  Natural processes and attempting to move the Rossnowlagh beach and dunes further east.</li>
	    <li>Human induced factors include the progressive removal of the cobble storm beach, primarily for bulding purposes, that lies between the dunes and the beach.  Asa result, storm ridge created by the cobbles is less capabel of dissipating wave energy.  Furthermore, due to pressure from recreation, the variation of species in the dune system is lessened and the natural resilience of the dune and beach system is threatened.The armour which protects the dune front has resulted in wave reflection and subsequent scouring of the beach by removing sand.  This is a serious threat where the flat to concave beach profile and the absence of sand accumulation structures suggest that sand supply is limited</p>

      <b>Implications of Climate Change for Rates of Coastal Erosion in Ireland</b>
      
      <p>
	Climate change predicts an increase in relative sea level and also a change in the frequency and magnitude of coastal storms.  For Ireland predictions indicate the occurrence of fewer	but more intense storms concentrated in the winter season with the southwest and northeast regions in particular becoming more stormy. These changes are predicted to have a greater impact on rates of coastal erosion than relative sea level rise.  However, rising sea levels will serve to amplify the effects of coastal storms on rates of erosion. Under climate change scenarios, c. 1700 km of the coastline is at particular risk of coastal erosion and we can expect rates of erosion at these vulnerable locations to increase.  Rates of increase will be determined by local coastal circumstances, e.g. geology, coastal configuration - exposure, sediments, supply factor.

      <h2>Coastal Flooding</h2>
      
      
      
      <div id="text-box">
	<p>Projected increases in relative sea level are of concern and constitute a threat to lowlying lands over long periods, particularly those located in the south and the east of Ireland.  However, when increases in relative sea level are combined with projected increase in storm surge height, a possible more immediate threat may arise from individual storm surge events. </p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Flooding from estuaries or the sea is generated from sea levels (a combination of astronomical tides, surges, winds and waves) exceeding the level of and hence spilling onto the neighbouring land. Of particular concern for Ireland is the occurence of flooding resulting from wind driven surges occurring in combination with astronomical high tides.</p>
      
      <b>Sea Level Rise</b> 
      
      
      <p>Sea level rise is primarily a result of increasing global temperatures which causes thermal expansion of the oceans (warmer water is less dense than colder water) and the loss of land-based ice (e.g. glaciers and ice sheets, permafrost).  In addition, relative sea level rise is determined by isostatic glacial adjustment.  This refers to the phenomenon of how the earth readjusts to a stable shape after its loading by ice sheets.  For example, during the last glaciation which lasted approximately 100,000 to 8,000 years before present, wide areas of the earth, including Ireland, were covered by ice sheets extending over thousands of kilometres with thicknesses of up to 4km.  These loads depressed the earth's surface down vertically by hundreds of meters.  After these ice sheets had melted away, the earth's surface rebounded but due to the properties of the earth's mantle, this occurs rather slowly.  This retarded rebound is an ongoing process and as a result, the altitude of the earth's surface is not fixed and relative sea level (RSL) rise is determined by a combination isostatic-glacial adjustment (land subsidence or uplift) with sea level rise.  Moreover, and amongst others, globally, spatial variations in relative sea level are determined by spatial variations in sea surface heating and ocean circulation.</p>  
      
      <div class="picture">

The red curve shows reconstructed sea level fields since 1870 (updated from Church and White, 2006); the blue curve shows coastal tide gauge measurements since 1950 (from Holgate and Woodworth, 2004) and the black curve is based on satellite altimetry (Leuliette et al., 2004). The red and blue curves are deviations from their averages for 1961 to 1990, and the black curve is the deviation from the average of the red curve for the period 1993 to 2001. Error bars show 90% confidence intervals.</div>
	Globally, sea level rise has risen by an average of 1.7 mm per year through the 20th century.  However, for the period 1993 to 2012, a significant increase in the rate global of sea level rise has been observed with  satellite measurements indicating an average rise of 3.18 mm per year.  For Ireland, long term observational data from tide gauges which provide measurements of sea level relative to the land are deficient to make accurate estimates of sea level rise.  However, satellite observations suggest that the sea level around Ireland has increased by 2-3 mm per year since the early 1990s.  In addition to measurements from Ireland, an extensive network of tide gauges situated around the UK provide supporting evidence of these changes.  Analysis of these data indicate a mean sea level rise of 1.7 mm per year since 1916.  This rise has been attributed to climate related changes and are thought indicative of the situation to the south of Ireland.  
	
	<b>Storm Surge</b>
      <p>The observational record for the Northeast Atlantic and the area around Ireland, indicate that the total number of storms has decreased slightly over the period 1965 - 1995.  However, storms are now concentrated in the winter and the intensity of these storms has increased.  In contrast, summers have tended to be calmer.</p>
      
      <b>Projected Changes in Sea Level and Storm Surges</b>
      <p>
	Globally, projected sea level rise for the period to 2100 are in the range of 0.09-0.88 m with a mean figure from all climate models of 0.48 m.  However, these estimates do not account for the additional rise that might be accounted for by the loss of land-based ice.  This is due to a lack of research in the areas but estimate suggest that with the addition of meltwater from land based ice, sea level rise might be as much as 6m by the end of the century. 
      </p>
      <p>
	When examining the impacts of projected rates of sea level rise for Ireland, the effect of isostatic rebound is of importance. Spatial variations in rates of isostatic rebound rates for Ireland are a result of the location of main ice sheet where the maximum weight was concentrated.  In Ireland, the ice sheet was centred in the north and as a result, in these areas the greatest depression of land took place.  South of a line from Galway to Dublin, isostatic rebound is slight while to the north, the land is continuing to rise.  As a result, areas of the south will likely feel the affects of sea level rise first, particularly low-lying coastal locations situated on soft or easily eroded materials and coastal floodplains.   In addition, projected changes in sea levels are expected to enlarge the horizontal and vertical extent of estuaries.  This will result in the penetration of tides further upstream and would impede the flow of rivers and result in estuarine flooding.</p>
      
      <p>
	Due to Ireland's location location in the west of Europe, exposure to Atlantic storms is of concern and this is particularly the case in the context of rising sea levels.  According to the IPCC, there is likely to be an increase in the number of intense cyclones and associated strong winds, particularly over the North Atlantic.  These changes will have a direct impact on storm surges which are caused by the occurence of low pressure weather systems and their associated strong winds.  Moreover, rising sea levels will enhance the impacts of storm surges.  For Ireland,  modelling results indicate that for Irish waters storm surge heights are increasing in frequency around all Irish coastal areas with the exception of the south and by up to 20% in the north and west.  There is also an increase in extreme storm surge heights along the west and east coasts, with most of the extreme surges occurring in winter <span class="reference">[3]</span>.  As a result, when combined with projected increases in coastal storms in winter, sea level rise may result in inundation of coastal areas and this could have major economic, social and environmental implications as all Ireland's major cities are located on the coast.</p>
      
      <b>Projected Innundation</b>
      <p>
	Not atking into account the existence of coastal defences of isostatic-glacial adjustment, under a projected sea level rise of 0.5 m, it is estimated that 986 km<sup>2</sup> or 7.9% of land area in the Republic of Ireland is at risk of innundation and this is particularly the case for low lying areas of the Irish coast.  The counties most at risk under a sea level rise of 0.5 m are Wexford, Kerry and Cork.  However, in terms of relative land vulnerabilities, Dublin , Louth and Weford are at highest risk.
      </p>
      <div class="picture-large">
	<img src="/img/ireland_flooding_vulnerable.jpg">
	</br>
      </div>
      <p>
	Sea level rise presents itself as a serious problem where infrastructure is at risk.  Ireland's major cities all lie on the coast and these will be at particular risk as impacts may be enhanced due to the inability of the shoreline to adjust naturally to a change in sea level.  However, of more immediate concern than sea level rise is the impacts of storm surge superimposed on relative sea level rise.  On the basis of a sea level rise of 0.48m coupled with an extreme surge of 2.6 m, it is estimated that approximately 300 km<sup>2</sup> of land would be at > 50% risk of innundation <span class="reference">[4]</span>.  While the current return period for such an event is lower on the east than the west coast, an increase in frequency for such events is projected for both coasts and indicates that a substantal amount of land could be innundated on a more regular basis.</p>

	  </div>
	  <p>On February 1st 2002, a spring tide coincided with a low pressure system in the Atlantic which generated conditions that propoagated into teh Irish sea in teh form of a surge wave.  This combied with strong southwesterly winds lead to an extreme water level of 2.9 m above Mean Sea Level being recorded at Dublin Port.  This is the highest annual extreme high water level ever recorded for Dublin Port since records began in 1923.  An examination of these levels indicate that the actual tidal range of 2.2 m was not unusual and on its own would not have caused flooding of Dublin.  However, with the added impacts due to storm surge (range pf 1.3 m) a tide of 2.95 mOD led to extensive flooding througout parts of Dublin and Fingal.Moreover, Around Dublin, the tidal flooding also caused an increase in water levels in rivers, the rivers Liffey, Dodder, Tolka and Rooyal Canal all burst their banks.</p>
	  <p>Climate change projections indicate a sea level rise of 0.48 m over the coming century.  Moreover, climate projections indicate an increase in the magnitude of storm surges, particularly on eastern and western coasts.  As a result, in the context of climate change in the current century and in order to ensure that structures close to the coast are adequetely protected, a figure of 4 m would be appropriate for the east coast of Ireland.  This figure comprises of a rise in sea level of 0.5 m, a strom surge of 2.95 m and an added safety margin.</p>

      <h2>Inland Flooding</h2>
      <div id="text-box">
	Projected climatic change, changes in precipitation patterns and rate of evapotranspiration in particular, is likely to result in changes in the hydrological cycle and increased flood risk. This is particularly the case for those catchments with fast response times. 
      </div>
      <p>
	Inland flooding is a function of rates of precipitation and evaporation and also catchment characteristics which determine levels of surface and/or groundwater runoff.  Catchment characteristics such as soil permeability, geology and topography all determine reponse to precipitation.  In addition to the basic hydrological parameters, human activities such as the development of land-use and infrastructure interventions (e.g. reservoirs and flood defences) also affect flood hazard.  Importantly, for some areas, flood defences that have been built according to design standards based on the probability of floods in the current climate may be at risk of failure under future conditions.
      </p>
      
      <b>Projected variations in precipitation and runoff for Ireland</b>
      <p>
	Long-term records of riverflow for Ireland indicate an increasing trend and this is particularly the case for annual and winter high flows.  Projected climatic data for Ireland would indicate that this trend will continue.  Climate change projections of precipitation for Ireland indicate changes in both the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation and these changes will have a direct effect on flood risk.</p>
      <p>The key projections produced for Ireland exhibit differences in the extent and spatial distributions of  projected precipitation and this is reflecting the relatively high degree of uncertainty in these projections. Nonetheless, there is agreement in the overall direction of change.  Projections indicate that precipitation will become increasingly seasonal with winters becoming significantly wetter (20%) by the mid to late 20th century and summers drier.  Moreover, the occurrence of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase.</p>
      <p>Projected changes in the spatial distribution of runoff indicate a gradient similar to that observed for projected precipitation with an east-west gradient of increasing runoff.  Spatial variations in levels of projected effective runoff are also evident and this is due to differences in soil, landuse and hydrological parameters which determine levels of catchment storage.  Increases in winter runoff are projected over large areas of the west and in the 2061-2090 scenareio, increases are also evident in the east of Ireland, in the Wicklow mountains.

	<b>Projecting future Changes in Inland Flooding</b>
      <p>
	In order to assess how climate change will affect the frequency and magnitude of inland flooding, projected climate data is employed to drive hydrological models that have been developed/parameterized for specific catchments. However, the employment of hydrological models amplifies existing uncertainties in climate models.</p>
      
      <p>There is already considerable uncertainty surrounding the choice of the Global Climate Model (GCM),the choice of the Regional Climate Models to transfer large-scale climatology to regional scale climatology and in projecting future hydrological response to climate change, the choice of and parameterisation of the hydrological model.  Nonetheless, projected changes in hydrological regimes have been developed for a wide range of catchments in Ireland.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, modelling results indicate that increased precipitation will result in an increase in winter and spring stream flow and coupled with the predicted increase in extreme precipitation events, an elevated risk of flooding.  However, individual catchment responses will be determined by their respective catchment characteristics.  For the most part, increasing stream flow has been projected to occur for those catchments with fast response times, i.e. little capacity to store water. Moreover, projections indicate that impact of climate change on flood behaviour is higher for low frequency events (floods with a return period of 100 years) than for high frequency events (floods with return periods of 5 years) <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00750778.2011.615707" target="blank">(Murphy et al. 2011.)</a>.

	The increase in magnitude and frequency of flood events would suggest significant impacts for areas already at risk of flooding.  As a preliminary assessment, the graph below indicates areas communities potentially at a significant level of fluvial flood risk.  For more information on areas flooded in the past, the <a href="http://www.floodmaps.ie" target="blank"> National Flood Hazard Mapping website </a> developed by Office of Public Works provides information on previous flood events. In addition, the magnitude of projected changes would indicate that areas currently not prone to flood risk may become more prone to flooding in the future.  This is particularly the case for those areas located at the confluence of major rivers or those areas located around estuaries where increased sea level rise in combination with increased river outflow may cause extensive estuarine flooding.</p>

    <h2>Water Scarcity</h2>

      Projections indicate decreased levels of precipitation during the summer months and this will lead to significant decreases in levels of water supply.  Moreover, increased demand due to higher summer temperatures may make the provision of potable water problematic during the summer months.
    </div>
    <p>
      Availability of fresh water through surface and groundwater flows is determined by the seasonality of precipitation and temperature, as well as by catchment characteristics such as geology, soils and landcover.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns modify the annual water budget of river basins as well as the timing and seasonality of river flows and groundwater interactions.  As a result, a changing climate may have potentially detrimental impacts on the fresh water resources.  However, the characteristics of water supply systems will also have a strong bearing on vulnerability to climate change.  For a water supply system with large excess capacity (a resilient water supply system), a large change in climate will have little effect.  However, and in contrast, for a water supply system with little excess capacity and that is operating at, or close to capacity, even a small change in climate can have a large effect and may tip the system past a critical threshold where demand for water exceeds supply.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ireland, water resources are dominated by surface waters with groundwaters making a relatively small contribution to drinking water supply.  Observational records indicate a decrease in late summer and early Autumn river flows and this trend is projected to continue.  Climate projections for Ireland do provide a strong indication of decreasing river flow for summer and autumn months and these changes are expected to become more pronounced as the century progresses.  This will result in decreased levels of water availability during the summer months.  Moreover, projected increase in temperature are expected to result in increased demand during the summer months.  For example, increasing tempertaures will result in an increased irrigation requirement for agricultual crops.</p>
    
    <p>There is a high degree of confidence in projections of temporal vairations in precipitation.  However, the actual location of future water resources remains unclear and further work is required to reduce teh uncertainty in spatial variations in future water supply.  Nonetheless, current projections indicate that teh west of Ireland will become wetter and this would suggest that future significant water resources will be located in the west.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to decreased flows, the projected increase in occurence in extreme events will have a detrimental impact on water quality and will affect the availability of potable water.  This is due to increased levels of runoff and associated contaminants to watercourses.  For example, the heavy rainfall of summer 2012 and the occurence of sudden changes in raw water quality arising from the subsequent flooding compromised a number of water supply systems, two of which were reported as being contaminated by the VTEC <i>E. coli</i> strain.

      Currently in Ireland, there is little excess capacity/headroom in meeting water demand.  For example, in the Dublin Region, it is expected that demand will outstrip supply by 2022 at the latest.  Moreover, in 2008, the national average for level of unaccounted for water was 43%. As a result, the resillience of the water supply system is already under threat water supply and projected decreases in levels of water resources is a key concern.  Moreover, increasing demand, due to increased temperatures, on limited water resources will require careful management.  This is particularly the case as projected periods of decreased water availability are likely to occur during periods of high demand, i.e. summer.  For example, in argriculture, we can expect to see increasing demand due to irrigation requirements.

  <a name="Loss of Biodiversity"/>
  <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
  
  <p>Ireland's biodiversity and their ability to deliver ecosystem services (e.g. flood protection, prevention of soil erosion and provision of clean air and water) is determined by a range of factors of which climate plays a pivotal role.  This is because for most species and habitats, climatic tolerances are largely fixed.  For example, blanket bogs are rare on a global scale and their distribution restricted to temperate maritime regions characterised by cool summers, mild winters and year round rainfall.  As a result, a change in climate, both in the climate average and also in the frequency of climatic extremes, will have significant implications on the distribution of blanket bogs habitats.  The loss of habitat is probably the greatest threat to biodiversity conservation.  .</p> 
  
  <p>Many aspects of Ireland's biodiversity are already at risk from a variety of pressures (e.g. intensification of agriculture, poorly managed commercial forestry, peat extraction, land clearance and development and these pressures are expected to continue into the future. Until recently, human induced climate change was not thought a significant pressure on biodiversity.  However, as the rate of climate change accelerates, it is projected to become one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. 
  </p>
  
  <b>Observed changes in Biodiversity</b>
  <p>
    Over the recent past, warming temperatures have resulted in observed changes in the distribution of species globally.  For terrestrial environments, there has been a consistent shift of species poleward or toward higher altitudes.  However, this shift in species is counterbalanced for many species by a lack of suitable habitats or a lack of interconnected habitats through which species might migrate.  Moreover, this shift has favoured warm species while those species more suited to cold conditions and at the limit of their southerly range are under threat as temperatures increase.  For Ireland, this global trend is apparent in the arrival of the little Egret, a new breeding bird species, which have extended their range into Ireland since the early 1990s.  Since then, this species has spread to many areas along the south and east coast of Ireland</p>

  <p>Observed increases in temperatures are also impacting upon the lifecycle events of species and stimulating an earlier spring onset of various biological events.  For example, from 30 years of data, from 4 phenological gardens throughout Ireland, leaves are emerging on trees earlier each year indicating that the beginning of the growing season is starting earlier.  However, in addition to extending the growing season, this earlier leafing of trees makes them particularly vulnerable to the occurence of late frosts.  Moreover, for 9 out of 11 long distant migrant species of birds, the spring arrival date is occurring earlier than previously and this is considered as being a result of an increase in temperature along the migration route.</p> 

  <p>Evidence indicates that the increased occurence of extreme events will have detrimental impacts on habitats.  For example, data from the UK and Ireland indicate that approximately 50% of peatland slippages occur in the late summer months as a consequence of convective storm activity). Climate change will also provide opportunities for invasive species an for Ireland, as an island nation, this is particularly important.  
  </p>

  <b>Projected implications of Climate Change on Ireland's Biodiversity</b>
  <p>
    To date, there has been little work undertaken on the impacts of projected climate change on biodiversity in Ireland.  Nonetheless, for the terrestrial environment, key projected climatic changes include warmer and drier summers with a longer growing season.  The increased occurrence of extreme weather events will also likely have detrimental effects on terrestrial species and habitats.</p>  
  <p>
    Plant species particularly threatened by climate change are species that are already threatened due to a variety of factors and reasons; species that occur in restricted or vulnerable habitats; species that are particularly prone to loss due to competition from invasive alien plants; species that may be adversely affected by related changes to the biodiversity in their ecosystems.  For example, of Irelands native species of flowering plants which number 850, 20% appear to be particularly vulnerable to climate change to 2050.  For those species already threatened, 52% may have their situation made potentiall worse while 3% of species that are not currently threatened in Ireland are likely to become threatened under climate change.  Click <a href="http://www.botanicgardens.ie/news/20080122.htm" target="blank">here</a> for a list of native Irish species identified as being threatened by climate change, </p>  
  <p>
    Changes in species distribution and or their functioning will likely have a significant impact on the habitats that they constitute.  For example, the loss of habitats in many areas is expected to due to a shift in habitat conditions.  However, if the biological elements are unable to migrate, then the new habitat areas may be of lower quality for many species.  Based on an initial assessment, the most vulnerable habitats are: Raised Bogs, Blanket Bogs, Cladium Fens, Petrifying Springs, Turloughs and Bog Woodland.  Moreover, priority habitats for further assessment include Coastal Lagoons, Decalcified Empetrum Dunes, Decalcified Dune Heath, Orchid Rich Grassland/Calcareous Grassland, Specieis Rich Nardus Upland Grassland, Residual Alluvial Forests and Yew Woodlands.

      <b>Information Box - Peatlands</b>
      <p>Peatlands cover 16.2% of the land mass of Ireland and this figure is only exceeded in global terms by three other countries (Finland, Canada and Indonesia).   In Ireland, three types of peatlands occur - Fens, Raised bogs and Blanket Bogs - all of which are though vulnerable to climatic changes  This is because peatlands are fed primarily by rainwater and as a result any change in the hudrological balance due to changes in rainfall will affect the peatland vegetation pattern and reduce the peat forming mosses.  Such changes threaten the very survival of peatlands.</p>

      <p>Projected changes in climate, reduced levels of summer precipitation and increased temperatures are expected to result in a decrease in the level of the water table in the summer months. The effects of projected changes in rainfall and temperature have been modelled for Irish peatlands and it is estimated that under projected climatic change for the period 2055, areas suited for the growth of fens, Raised Bogs, Atlantic Blanket Bogs and Mountain Blanket Bogs will reduce by 41, 31, 39 and 31% respectively.  By 2075, respective estimates are 42, 38, 40 and 37%.  Moreover, the increased occurence of extreme events is expected to result in more slippage events and increased levels of erosion. Importantly, climate-induced  modifications in the nutrient cycle may lead to peatlands becoming net emitters of carbon.    </p>
