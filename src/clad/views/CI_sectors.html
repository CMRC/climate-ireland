	<b>Climate Change will impact upon all aspects of Ireland's environment, economy and society </b> 
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual sectors will face differing climate change impacts and will also be presented with differing opportunities.  
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>For example:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Agriculture:</b> key projected climate changes include higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, wetter winters and drier summers.  In order to adapt, farmers will have to adopt earlier planting and harvesting dates, lower fertilizer application rates and significant capital investment in irrigation equipment.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Water Management:</b> Projections indicate that climate change will have a significant impact on river flows and water resources. Models indicate that in Ireland, winters will be wetter and summer drier.  However, when showers occur, they are likely to be heavier leading to an increased risk of flooding.  Moreover decreases in summer rainfall coupled with a rise in evapotranspiration will mean that reductions in streamflow are likely, particularly during the summer months.  This will lead to problems of water supply.  Adaptation measures include ensuring that water supply sources and associated infrastructure are sufficiently robust to meet future demand.

	<p>
	<b>This section details some of the challenges and opportunities that each sector is likely to face, identifies some adaptation options and illustrates these through case study examples.</b>

	Increased temperatures and decreased levels of precipitation in summer increase the likelihood of having 'good weather', a key motivation in the choice of holiday destination.  However, a changing climate will also have the potential for negative impacts on Irish tourism and the adoption of appropriate adaptation responses will be critical in taking advantage of our changing climate.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunties</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Increased temperatures and drier summers will provide the opportunity for a more prolonged tourist season with expansion from the present peak tourism months (May-August) into 'shoulder' months of April and September/October</li> 
	<li>Climate change will result in increasing temperatures and drier weather in the Mediterranean regions and is expected to result in decreased tourist flows as it becomes uncomfortably hot.  This combined with decreased availability of water will mean a shift away from this region is likely.  This shift will expand into higher latitudes and altitudes.  Consequently, northern European countries, including Ireland, are likely to become more favourable holiday destinations.</li>
	<li>Under these conditions, a higher number of domestic tourists are expected.</li>
	<li>Under projected climate conditions, the diversification of tourism activities is expected including the development of outdoor activities and the expansion of nature-based activities.</li>
	</ul><b>Key Impacts</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Water supply in Ireland is designed to cater for the permanent population and it does not take into account increased numbers due to tourist arrivals when populations of small towns (e.g. Killarney) can double over the tourist season.  Climate change will have serious implications for water management and consideration of water infrastructure at pivotal locations to allow for consumption of water across all seasons will be required.</li>
	<li>Water-based activites (e.g. angling and boating) are a primary tourism and recreational activity.  Under a changing climate, there is to be an expected increase in the attractiveness of these activities.  However, climate change will have negative impacts on the quality of water with a greater risk of eurtophication, low flows in water bodies, marine ecosystems and fish stocks may be altered and increased storminess may impact on coastal activities</li>
	<li>Any impacts on the natural environment such as those posed by climate change are likely to impact on tourism and tourist perception of Ireland.  Ireland's landscape and associated colours rely on Ireland's temperate and precipitous climate and with projected decreases in levels of rainfall, the green landscape associated with Ireland is likely to change</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<p>Appropriate adaptation response will maximise Ireland's potential for tourism in a changing climate and these adaptation options include both hard and soft measures.  Examples include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Eduction and Training on issues of climate change for Tourism</li>
	<li>Adaptation of destination - climate proofing and retros-fitting</li>
	<li>Changing operating patterns and divserisfying activities</li>
	</ul>
