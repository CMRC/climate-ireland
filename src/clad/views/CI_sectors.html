	<b>Climate Change will impact upon all aspects of Ireland's environment, economy and society </b> 
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual sectors will face differing climate change impacts and will also be presented with differing opportunities.  
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>For example:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Agriculture:</b> key projected climate changes include higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, wetter winters and drier summers.  In order to adapt, farmers will have to adopt earlier planting and harvesting dates, lower fertilizer application rates and significant capital investment in irrigation equipment.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Water Management:</b> Projections indicate that climate change will have a significant impact on river flows and water resources. Models indicate that in Ireland, winters will be wetter and summer drier.  However, when showers occur, they are likely to be heavier leading to an increased risk of flooding.  Moreover decreases in summer rainfall coupled with a rise in evapotranspiration will mean that reductions in streamflow are likely, particularly during the summer months.  This will lead to problems of water supply.  Adaptation measures include ensuring that water supply sources and associated infrastructure are sufficiently robust to meet future demand.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>This section details some of the challenges and opportunities that each sector is likely to face, identifies some adaptation options and illustrates these through case study examples.</b>

	<b>Key Information</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Globally, <b>atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> are projected to increase</b> from current average levels of 400 ppm to 500 and 600 ppm by the years 2050 and 2100 respectively.  This increase is expected to <b>improve net biomass production of agricultural crops</b>.</li>
	<li>Compared to current conditions, <b>average temperatures will increase by 1-3&deg;C by the end of the century</b>. Soil and water temperatures are expected to vary inline with temperature changes.</li> 
	<li>Projections indicate that for winters, conditions currently experienced along the southwest will spread throughout the country while for summers, <b>the greatest warming will be experienced away from the coast.</b></li>
	<li>Rainfall changes  are more uncertain but <b>wetter winters</b> are likely for most parts of the country and this is particularly the case for the west.  This will result in <b>difficulties in accessing land</b> with heavy machinery and this will have <b>implications for, amongst others, planting, harvesting and fertilizer application.</b></li> 
	<li><b>Summers are projected to be drier</b>, particularly in eastern areas and this will result in the <b>increased requirement for irrigation</b>.</li>
	<li>An <b>increased frequency of heat waves and drought</b> is expected and this will result in heat stress for both plants and animals while the <b>occurrence of cold snaps and frost days is expected to decrease</b>.  This will have implications for pest die-off and plant health</li>
	<li>The <b>duration of the growing season is expected to increase</b> with spring occurring earlier.</li> 
	</div>
	
	<p>
	<div class="picture right"> <img src="/img/cows.jpg" align="right"> <br/>Grass is one of the most important agricultural crops in Ireland and climate change will have important implications for it's farming.</div>
	</p>
	<p>
	Agriculture is one of Ireland's most important indigenous sectors and accounts for approximately 64% of the total land area of Ireland.  Approximately 80% of the agricultural area is devoted to grass (silage, hay and pasture), 11% is devoted to rough grazing and the remainder is allocated to crop production.  Beef and milk production currently account for around 58% of agricultural output. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Globally, climate change is expected to have severe impacts on agriculture and this is due to two interacting factors.  Firstly, increased levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is generally beneficial to the process of photosynthesis and this would be expected to improve net biomass production of agricultural crops.  This is particularly the case for temperate locations such as Ireland.  In contrast, climate change is expected to impact on agricultural productivity negatively through the increased occurrence of drought and excessive temperatures which may negate the positive impact of increased levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.   For Ireland, the impacts of climate change are not expected to be as severe as those predicted for those areas at lower latitudes.  As a result, climate change may offer opportunities for Irish agriculture.  Nonetheless, all aspects of agriculture in Ireland will be affected by climate change and the key climatic changes include increasing atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns.
	</p>
	Adaptation to weather conditions has always been a part of farm management and to some extent adaptation to climate change follows the same principles as adaptation to short term oscillations in weather conditions.  Nonetheless, climate change is predicted to have significant impacts on agriculture at a global level and for Ireland, although the predicted impacts are less severe and in some cases may provide opportunities for the Irish agricultural sector through increased productivity and the creation of new market opportunities, adaptation is required.  Moreover, it is thought that Irish agriculture will be capable of adapting to climate change and that most of the current crops will remain viable. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Autumn and Spring yields may increase</b> due to higher temperatures and increased levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.  However, for the east and southeast of Ireland in particular, benefits may be offset due to decreased water availability resulting from decreased levels of summer precipitation.</li>
	<li>Higher air temperatures may mean <b>shorter housing periods and earlier turnout dates</b> for cattle in some areas and there may be potential to <b>increase livestock production</b> as a result of increased grass yield potential.  However, turnout date is dependent on changing patterns of precipitation which may mean that turnout might not happen due to risk of soil damage and flooding.</li>
	<li>Adverse impacts of climate change elsewhere may <b>create new market opportunities.</b></li> 
	<li>Less spring frost will result in <b>less frost damage</b> to spring crops, potential <b>improved conditions for horticulture</b> and <b>less cold stress to animals.</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Due to <b>decreased levels of summer precipitation</b>, particularly in the east of Ireland, <b>water stress</b> in grass, barley, potato and to a lesser extent maize will occur  much more often.  Growing of the potato may become unviable.</li>
	<li><b>Increased requirements for irrigation</b> would also have major impacts on the machinery, economy and labour requirements.</li>
	<li>Increased temperatures will result in <b>heat stress</b> for animals and this can <b>lower productivity</b> by decreasing appetite and increasing susceptibility to disease.</li> 
	<li>The projected increased in the frequencies of heat waves may mean that <b>plant and animal systems become stressed</b> resulting in lower productivity in crop and milk yields.</li>
	<li><b>Plant diseases which are currently rare, such as Rhizomania, may occur more frequently</b> and farm animals may suffer more from a range of <b>tick borne pathogens</b>.  <b>Existing problems for cereals</b>, such as septoria, nodurum and Brown Rust <b>may be exacerbated.</b></li>
	<li><b>Wetter winters</b> will adversely effect the <b>mobility of machinery</b> on fields.  For example, higher rainfall may mean that <b>access to land will be limited to the end of March</b>.  As a result, wetter winters will affect the <b>timing of planting, manure and fertilizer spreading</b> and result in a higher risk of soil poaching.</li>
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may require <b>increased levels of drainage</b> during higher precipitation events.</li>  
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may result in <b>nutrient leaching, pollution and soil erosion</b> impacting upon water resources.</li> 
	
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Due to problems of machinery mobility, <b>earlier planting and harvesting dates</b> will need to be adopted.</li>
	<li>The <b>risk of reduced water quality</b> due to higher levels of winter precipitation may be addressed through <b>lower levels of fertilizer application.</b></li>
	<li>The risk of water-logging during the winter months may be addressed through <b>increased drainage</b>.  Moreover, the <b>conservation of winter rainfall</b> may offset the deficit in supply during the summer months.</li>
	<li><b>Significant investment in irrigation equipment</b> might be required to maintain productivity during the summer months.</li>
	<li>Traditional crops such as potatoes may become uneconomic to grow due to irrigation costs and <b>alternative crops, e.g. maize,</b> may need to be considered.</li>

	Projected climatic changes for Ireland, increasing temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in particular, are expected to increase growth rates of Irish forests.  However, increased rates of growth may negatively impact on timber quality and this growth may be limited by the decreased availability of water and nutrients, difficulties in establishing forests and increased risk of disease, pathogens and fire.
	</p>
	<p>
	Forests have developed alongside the naturally changing climate over millennia.  As climate shifted slowly, the natural environment presented few barriers and species and communities could adapt and evolve.  However, the rapid pace of human-induced climate change have overcome species ability to cope and the increased level of commercial afforestation, consisting of exotic conifers and predominately established on marginal or unsuitable lands may mean further adjustment to cope with climate change. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Forestry currently occupies just 10% of the landcover of Ireland, they are young and productive and research suggests that a doubling of forest cover is well within reach.  The management of forestry is a long-term process and forests in Ireland are generally worked on rotation periods (between planting and final harvest) of 40-50 years.  Within this timeframe, climate change is projected to have a significant impact and as a result, introducing and/or adapting management practice that strengthen the ability of forests to withstand the impacts of climate change will be critical.   
	</p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub></b>, a substrate for plant photosynthesis is thought to <b>increase tree growth</b>.  However, the effects of this are variable and dependent upon a wide range of factors including location and age of forest stock.</li>
	<li>Increasing temperatures are expected to <b>increase the length of the growing season</b> and result in increased tree growth.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Decreased levels of summer rainfall</b> and <b>increased levels of evapotranspiration</b> may result in <b>loss of vigour</b> at some sites.  However, most Irish sites are situated on lands deemed marginal or unsuitable for agriculture and in general, these sites are associated with high water-holding capacity.  Nonetheless, periods of summer drought may be detrimental in the establishment of forests where roots have not yet fully developed.
	</li>
	<li>Under projected climate change for Ireland, the <b>frequency and intensity of storms and windiness are expected to increase</b> and these increases might have a detrimental effect on Irish forests through <b>blowdown</b>, particularly those forests located on relatively exposed sites.
	</li>
	<li>
	Climate change will have an impact upon the <b>spatial and temporal dynamics of pest species</b>, influencing the frequency and consequences of outbreaks and their spatial patterns, size and geographical range.  Projected increases in temperature for Ireland are expected to increase the threat of pathogens while projected decreases in the frequency of cold snaps is expected to decrease die-off of pests. Moreover, insect populations will exploit situations where tress are already stressed due to, amongst others, storm damage, drought or flooding.
	<li>
	Currently, forest fires are relatively infrequent in Irish forests.  Weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind) control the inflammability of Irish forests.  However, a <b>warmer and drier conditions will only increase the risk of forest fire</b>.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Certain tree species require frost</b> as part of their growth cycle, projected decreases in the occurrence of frost days may have detrimental effects on these.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<ul>
	<li>In a potentially milder climate with <b>wetter winters</b>, the <b>timing of preparation, planting, harvesting and transport may become critical</b>.</li>  
	<li>Where <b>winters become wetter</b>, due to the use of heavy machinery and inaccessibility to land under wetter winter conditions, it may become necessary to complete <b>all preparatory work</b> in the summer and autumn <b>prior to planting</b> in winter.</li>
	<li>With a longer growing season, <b>optimal planting dates may be affected</b>, post planting care may also become critical and this is particularly the case for areas experiencing warmer drier summers which is commonly the cause of tree mortality in newly planted areas. </li>
	<li>Due to the use of heavy machinery, there may be <b>increased pressure to undertake harvesting in drier summer periods</b>.</li>
	<li>Projected climate changes indicate increased temperatures and this would suggest more favourable habitats for insects, pathogens and mammals (e.g. deer).</li>
	<li><b>Species suitability</b> may change and it is <b>important to consider the planting stock</b> when planning for climate change.</li>

	<h2>Biodiversity</h2></a>
	<div id="text-box">
	<b>Key Information</b>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Biodiversity is the variability among all living organisms including the ecological complexes of which they  are a part - it encompasses genetic, species and ecosystem diversity</b></li>
	<li>According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment <b>"By the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, climate change and its impacts may be the dominant direct driver of biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem services globally"</b>.</li>
	<li>For Ireland, <b>sea levels are expected to rise by 18 to 59 cm</b> above its current level <b>impacting upon coastal habitats</b>.</li>
	<li>Projected shifts in climate will impact upon the <b>geographical range and phenology</b> (the timing of lifecycle events) of species native to Ireland.</li> 
	<li>Projected shifts in climate, temperature and precipitation, will result in the <b>increased occurrence of invasive species</b>.</li>
	<li>Projected increases in the occurrence of <b>extreme events</b> may have devastating consequences for species and habitats.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
	<div class="picture right"><img src="http://www.biodiversityireland.ie/wp-content/gallery/insects-diptera/eristalis-tenax-k-murphy_1024x728.jpg"><br/>Ireland's location and climate results in a rich mix of biodiversity.
	</div>
	Ireland's natural landscape is one of its greatest assets and for its relatively small size, Ireland has a wide diversity of habitats as designated under the EU habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).  Due to Ireland's location on the western edge of Europe, subject to both maritime and continental conditions, the climate of Ireland is typified by spatial and temporal variability and in combination with the effects of physical geography, a locally variable climate across the region results.  This variable climate contributes greatly to biodiversity of Ireland and includes a mix of Atlantic, Arctic, Arctic-alpine and boreal elements.  
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition to its intrinsic value, biodiversity provides a wide range of ecosystem services and supports such diverse industries as agriculture, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, horticulture, construction and waste treatment.  Consequently, the loss of biodiversity threatens our food supply, opportunities for tourism and recreation and sources of food, medicine and energy.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Currently, many aspects of Ireland's biodiversity are already under threat from, amongst others, the intensification of agriculture, poorly managed commercial forestry, peat extraction, land clearance and development and invasive alien species.     This is already leading to habitat degradation and loss and the ensuing loss of biodiversity.  For example, Ireland's aquatic habitats and species have already been identified as being of bad conservation status.  It is in that this context that the threats and opportunities posed by climate change must be considered.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Climate and biodiversity are inextricably linked and global evidence indicates that species are already being affected by climate change, and studies in Ireland confirm this.  Phenology, the study of the timing of lifecycle events in the animal and plant world as influenced by the environment, has identified that changes in the lifecycle events of plants and birds have already been observed.
	<ul>
	<li>On average, leaves are emerging on trees earlier each year, indicating that the growing season  is increasing.</li>
	<li>For birds, long distance trans-continental summer migrants are arriving up to one week earlier now than was the situation 35 years ago and this is, at least, in part due to increasing spring temperatures.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Importantly, biodiversity can help us to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change in many ways and the protection of biodiversity can help us both mitigate against and adapt to climate change.  For example, protecting diodiversity can help limit greenhouse gas concentrations because forest, peatlands and other habitats are major stores of carbon.  Moreover, healthy ecosystems, e.g. coastal wetlands, can be employed to buffer against coastal erosion.  Therefore, ecosystem approaches should be an integral part of the overall mitigation and adaptation effort.
	</p>
	<p>
	A key area for management of and planning for biodiversity is that future climatic shifts could result in changes to species range dynamics.  A changing climate results in forced species migration.  However, the occurrence of impermeable landscapes restricts species movement and prohibits autonomous adaptation.  This decreases the relevance of current conservation strategies which seek to preserve pattern through the designation of fixed protection areas.  These natural/semi-natural areas will remain important but planning must now address biodiversity conservation at a landscape level and plan for interconnectivity between potentially available suitable landscape units and habitats.</p>
	<b>Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Bogs and wetlands</b> currently comprise of 15% of Ireland's land area, 8-11% of these remain relatively intact, and these can potentially be <b>employed as carbon stores and sinks.</b></li>
	<li>Wetland habitats can provide <b>natural flood defences</b> for both coastal and inland areas.</li>
	<li>Properly managed ecosystems can be employed to help <b>reduce and manage soil erosion</b>.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Impacts</b>
	<li> <b>20% of Ireland's total native flora</b> appear to be <b>particularly vulnerable to climate change</b> from the current period to 2050.</li>   
	<li><b>Species interactions will be impacted</b> upon by climate change.  For example, milder temperatures and earlier spring weather may mean that young birds do not hatch at the same time as their prey, affecting their ability to reach maturity and survive.</li>
	<li>Changing climate will result in <b>increased occurrences of invasive species and competitive pressure</b> on those species native to Ireland.</li>
	<li>Habitats will need to adapt to climate change, <b>fragmented isolated habitats will be the most vulnerable.</b></li>
	<li><b>Wetland habitats</b> may be damaged due to <b>drying out or erosion</b>, 40% of the suitable climatic areas for peatlands are projected to be lost by 2075.</li>
	<li>Some coastal habitats may be lost due to <b>sea level rise</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Extreme events</b>. may have unpredictable and profound impacts, <b>overwhelming any impacts due to changes in average climatic conditions</b>.</li>
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may result in <b>increased nutrient runoff, affecting water quality and fish survival</b>, and <b>soil erosion</b>, possibly impacting upon salmon and trout spawning areas.</li>
	
	</ul>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<ul>
	<li>A primary adaptation strategy to climate change and current variability is to <b>reduce and manage current stresses on species and ecosystems</b> by addressing issues such as habitat fragmentation and destruction, over-exploitation and eutrophication, while keeping the potential impacts of climate change in mind.</li>
	<li>It is of importance to <b>maintain viable, connected and genetically diverse ecosystems</b>, strategic national policies could co-ordinate with communal and private land-use systems to address these issues</li>
	<li>Establishment of <b>diverse agroforestry systems</b> to cope with increased risk from climate change.</li>
	<li><b>Conservation of agro-biodiversity</b> to provide specific gene pools and crops, to enhance the abilities of crop and livestock systems to adapt to climate change at a genetic level.</li>

	  <img src="/img/surge.jpg"/> <br/>Under projected climatic change, Ireland's coastal areas will be at increased risk of coastal erosion and flooding.</div>
	
	Coastal flooding and erosion pose serious threats to Ireland's economy, society and natural environment and this is particularly the case as Ireland's major cities (Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway) are located on the coast. Coastal flooding occurs when high tides, surges and wave-overtopping combine to inundate coastal areas.  Coastal erosion which is intimately linked with coastal flooding occurs when the sea progressively encroaches upon the land.
	</p>
	<p>
	In general, high tides do not occur exactly as predicted and the difference between the predicted normal tide level and the expected sea level is called a surge.  Currently, surges occur frequently and generally pass unnoticed.  However, in some cases, such as occurred in Dublin in September 2002 when a 1 metre surge coincided with one of the highest spring tides of the year, there are severe consequential social and economic impacts. With a modest increase in sea levels (40 cm), the frequency of flood events such as occurred in Dublin in February 2002, currently expected to occur once per century, are predicted to increase to once every five years if not more often.  
	</p>
	<p>Climate change projections indicate that mean sea level is expected to rise and this increase is not expected to result in serious inundation of the Irish coast.  However, coupled with the projected increases in  the intensity of coastal storms occurring in winter, wind-driven storm surges will significantly increase the risk of coastal flooding and erosion and this is particularly the case when wind-driven storm surges coincide with a high spring tide.  During these events, significant areas of land can be lost instantaneously.  Projected changes in sea levels are also expected to enlarge the vertical and horizontal extent of estuaries and this will result in the penetration of tides further upstream and this would impede the outflow from rivers and result in estuarine flooding.  Coupled with the increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events, this may have serious implications for flooding.  
	</p>
	
	<p>Climate change will impact upon and offer opportunities to all sectors operating in coastal areas and these include agriculture, biodiversity, marine and fisheries, critical infrastructure, and tourism.  Yet, planning and development decisions for coastal areas take place on a sectoral basis.  This fragmented approach to management leads to inefficient use of resources, conflicting claims on space and missed opportunities for adaptation of coastal areas to climate change.  However, projects on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime_spatial_planning/index_en.htm">Marine Spatial Planning</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/home.htm">Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)</a> call for a strategic approach to coastal zone planning in order to achieve a more sustainable coast.    
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Warming waters may bring additional opportunities for recreation and the <a href="tourism-cultural-heritage">tourism sector</a>.</li>
	<li>Warming waters may also bring opportunities for the <a href="marine-fisheries">fisheries sector</a> as new fish species will likely move from the southerly latitudes following warmer waters.</li>
	<li>For areas subject to coastal erosion, their managed retreat may contribute to ecosystem health and <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.  Managed retreat is generally designed to avoid hazards and prevent ecosystems from being squeezed between development and the advancing sea.  Mechanisms commonly include setbacks that require new development to be a minimum distance from the shore, density restrictions that limit development and rolling easement policies that allow development on condition that it be removed to enable wetlands to migrate landward.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Increased risk of the physical loss of land, coastal inundation</b> and resulting damage to infrastructure situated along the coast.</li>
	<li> Rising sea levels have the potential to <b>inundate freshwater ecosystems and affect the quality of ground waters</b>.  With projected decreases in summer rainfall, Ireland may become increasingly reliant on groundwater supply and their salinisation may have serious consequences for water supply.</li>
	<li>Projected <b>increases in sea surface temperatures</b> are expected to increase the intensity of cyclones which will result in <b>more extreme storm activity</b> with the potential to bring the devastation of storm surges to the coast of Ireland.</li>
	<li>Sea level rise, increased storminess and wave heights will likely <b>intensify erosion rates and accelerate loss of land</b>.</li>
	<li>In conjunction with increased surface water runoff, particularly due to extreme rainfall events, sea level rise and wind-driven storm surges may result in <b>estuarine and river flooding</b>.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<p>
	Due to the current and fragmented approach to planning and decision-making in coastal areas, <b>adaptation in the coastal zone might be facilitated by taking a strategic approach to planning</b> (e.g. ICZM), incorporating a <b>cross-sector perspective</b> and taking into account both the <b>terrestrial and marine components</b> of the coastal zone.</p> 
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Soft engineering approaches</b> can be taken to reduce coastal erosion and flooding which include beach nourishment, the artificial addition of sediments, dune rehabilitation, restoring or enhancing natural dune systems.</li>
	<li><b>Structures</b>, e.g. sea walls, can be built to <b>protect critical infrastructure</b> against coastal flooding and erosion.  However, these structures must take into account potential impacts on <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and on neighbouring coastal ecosystems.</li> 
	<li>Planned infrastructure can be <b>designed according to best available information and data</b> and <b>flood-proofed</b> through location above current and projected flood levels.</li>
	<li><b>Restoration or creating new wetland ecosystems along the coast</b> in order to provide <b>natural protection</b> against flooding and erosion.</li>
	<li><b>Regulatory measures</b>, e.g. zoning, can be taken to <b>ensure that development does not take place in areas subject to flooding</b> and buffer zones can be created.</li>
	<li>For the <b>key sectors</b> operating in coastal areas, <b>a range of adaptation options</b> are available to address the impacts of and take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change in coastal areas.

	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="/img/fisheries.jpg"/> <br/>Ireland's marine sector and its infrastructure will be at risk from climate change through increasing sea level, coastal flooding and erosion, and physio-chemical changes to the marine environment.</div>
	<p>Ireland's marine ecosystems (i.e. offshore, inshore, coastal)  are home to a rich and diverse range of species and habitats and our oceans are a national asset supporting an important and diverse marine economy.  In 2007, Ireland generated 1.2% of GDP from its marine economy and supported about 1% of the total workforce.  Our marine resources also provide non-commercial benefits such as amenity and biodiversity, as well as important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nutrient dispersal.  However, many believe that we can achieve greater economic return in the areas of seafood, tourism, marine renewable energy and new applications for health, medicine and technology</p> 
	
	<p> 
	 A changing climate has wide ranging implications for Ireland's marine environment and these will impact upon both the fisheries and aquaculture industries. Evidence suggests that changes in climate are already having an affect on the marine environment with a <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/northward-movement-of-zooplankton-between-1958-2005">northward shift in plankton distribution already being observed</a>.  This shift in turn impacts on higher trophic levels, effecting the distributions of species higher up the chain.  However, marine environments represent a wide range of complex and interacting ecosystems and understanding how climate change might affect these remains a key challenge. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For Ireland, predicted changes include a greater incidence of storm damage to coastal facilities and  due to increasing sea surface temperatures and climatic-induced variations in physico-chemical conditions,  a wide variety of impacts on marine life including species shift and modifications of primary production and food chains.  In addition, climatic shifts will have implications for both navigation and search and rescue operations.
	</p>
	
	<b>
	Key Opportunities
	</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Climatic change may make conditions more favourable for some high value species.  For example, species currently present on the south coast of Ireland or in northern France (e.g. such as turbot <i>Psetta maxima</i>, and sea bass <i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i> should have increased opportunities to become better established in Ireland.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>
	Key Impacts
	</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Warmer waters will result in more extreme storm activity, bringing high winds and storm surges to the coast of Ireland.  This will place those involved in maritime transport, commercial fisheries and off-shore energy enterprises at risk.</li>
	<li>Warmer waters also support lower levels of dissolved oxygen and provide favourable conditions for the growth of algal blooms.  This will exacerbate the impacts of nutrient runoff from the land and promote eutrophic conditions.  These conditions may also promote the growth of jellyfish populations, potentially causing catastrophic losses in coastal aquaculture and the closure of beaches.</li>
	<li>In addition to algal blooms, warmer waters may promote new types of bacteria and pathogenic viruses which can threaten fish and shellfish populations.</li>
	<li>Warming waters may also affect the biogeographical ranges of species distribution with likely reductions in the range of some northerly species while southerly species are likely to increase their range northward.</li>
	<li>Alterations in the acidity, salinity and sediment loading of waters around Ireland might present a significant risk.  Inshore waters serve as nurseries for many pelagic fish species, and also for traditionally harvested shellfish and commercial aquaculture.  Projected changes in patterns of precipitation and their effects upon levels of river discharge and could alter near shore sediment distributions.</li>
	<li>Due to increased absorption of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans, the equilibrium of inorganic carbon in sea water is being disrupted and pH reduced.  Acidification could cause a disruption in the capacity of such waters to support calcifying zooplankton due to acidification.</li> 
	</ul>
	<b>
	Adaptation
	</b>
	<p>The marine environment represents a wide-range of complex interacting ecosystems.  The effects of climate change on these ecosystems remains unclear.  As a result, continued monitoring and research is required to ensure that proper decisions on adaptation are taken.  In addition, better management of the marine environment and coasts is of great importance.</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>Adaptation in the marine environment needs to be integrated into County Development and Coastal Zone Management Plans.</li>
	<li>The marine manifestations of climate change should be taken into account in implementing the EU Water Framework Directive and the design of the national marine monitoring programme.</li>
	<li>Partnerships with existing European and transatlantic research institutions should be strengthened in order to improve national capabilities to predict and manage change and response in the marine environment.</li>
	<li>Develop and implement a national strategy and risk assessment strategy to combat against the trans-location of alien marine species.</li>
	<li>Identify the potential for the use of non-native and high value fish species in aquaculture.</li>
	<li>Facilitate the preservation and reporting of non-indigenous fish and invertebrates identified in coastal habitats and surveys.</li>
	<li>Give priority to time series measurements in the seas around Ireland.  These will allow for the quantification of seasonal trends in sea-surface temperatures, primary production, salinity, currents and wave climate in the seas surrounding Ireland.</li>
	<li>Establish a marine climate data archive, combining both historical and new information of relevance in the tracking of change in the marine ecosystem.</li>

	<h2>Critical Infrastructure</h2></a>
	<div id="text-box">
	<b>Key Information</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Coastal flooding and erosion pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure in Ireland (e.g. rail infrastructure and power stations), most of which is located on or near the coast.</li>
	<li>Projected increases in temperature will result in increased demand for electricity due to increased requirements for cooling, e.g. air conditioning and refrigeration.</li>
	<li>Supply of energy will be detrimentally affected by climate change.</li>
	<li>The occurrence of extreme events will cause damage and disruption to all critical infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
	<div class="picture right">
	<img src="http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/91/73/917332_bc9f70b0.jpg"></br>Most of Ireland's infrastructure has been located on the coast, areas which are at particular risk due to changes in climate.
	</div>
	<p>
	Ireland's critical infrastructure (Energy, transport and communications) are a vital part of Ireland's economic activities and in general represents long-term assets.  Critical infrastructure which guarantees our energy and water supplies and enables the reliable use of raod, rail and air transport is vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  Moreover, our critical infrastructure represents a highly interconnected system.  For example, if floods damage our energy supply, all other services can be affected.  As a result, adopting a long-term perspective, which includes accounting for the impacts of climate change, ensures that sound economic choices are made and avoids the risks of revisiting incremental decisions made on the basis of short-term pressures. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Due to ease of access and navigations, most of Ireland's major cities and general infrastructure has been located on the coast or in close proximity to rivers.  As a result, flood risk is of concern and under projected climate change, the risk of coastal and inland flooding will increase significantly and has major economic and social consequences for Irish cities, industry and critical infrastructure.  Moreover, drainage networks, in some cases dating to Victorian times, are at risk and in some cases have already been overwhelmed by recent storms.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Climate change will pose a challenge to the energy sector as this may result in decreased efficiencies in energy generation and also increased demand for extra energy.  Decreased efficiencies are projected for hydro power plants as a result of changes in surface water flows while the increasing temperatures of waters (sea or river) used to cool power thermal plants will result in decreased plant efficiencies.  The energy sector will also face an increasing demand for energy as a result of the increased requirement for pumping of water for water supply, wastewater disposal and irrigation.  In contrast, energy demand may decrease in winter due to decreasing temperatures. Climate change will also offer opportunities for the energy sector particularly in the area of renewable energy generation.    
	</p>
	<p>
	Transport  and communication networks are also at risk from projected changes in climate, particularly increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation and the increased occurrence and intensity of extreme events.  Heat stress on communication networks, the thermal expansion of road and rail, poses a threat but should not become an issue for a projected 3&deg;C change in temperature.  In contrast, heat waves have caused heat stress on public transport for many cities.  Wetter winters, particularly when flooding occurs will impact on transport infrastructure resulting in dangerous road conditions and decreased levels of comfort.  The increased frequency of extreme weather will have major effects on transport and communications resulting in storm damage to infrastructure and service disruption as a result of blocked/damaged transport networks.  Ships and transport are also at risk due to increased wave heights and risk of storm surge.   
	</p>
	<b>Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li>In the energy sector, the lead time from planning to operation can be 10-30 years and projections for energy supply generally look forward 30-40 years and take into account socio-economic and climate change factors.  As a result, in the planning of infrastructure, adaptation can be incorporated into codes and practices.</li>
	<li>Ireland's location provides a favourable setting for the generation of renewable energy, e.g. wind and wave energy.</li>
	<li>The potential for the generation of solar power will increase under projected climatic changes.</li>
	<li>Less snow and ice in winter will lead to fewer disruptions and decreased requirements for gritting.</li>
	<li>Less snow and ice through winter will result in decreased levels of frost/ice damage.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Impacts</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Increasing areas of land will become susceptible to flooding resulting in damage and disruption to critical infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Coastal erosion may result in the re-routing of transport and communication networks.</li>
	<li>Extreme weather events pose a significant risk to all critical assets.</li>
	<li>Extreme floods will affect dam safety.</li>
	<li>Extreme winds will damage overhead powerlines.</li>
	<li>Decreased surface water flows in summer and increased flows in winter will impact upon the efficiencies of hydro-power generation.</li>
	<li>Increased temperatures of surface waters used to cool thermal power plants will result in decreased levels of efficiency.</li>
	<li>The energy sector will face increased levels of demand due to increased energy requirements for the pumping of water.</li>
	<li>Increased potential for damages to wave and tide systems as a result of increased sea levels and storm surge.</li>
	<li> The growth of bioenergy crops may become problematic due to changes in phenology.</li>
	<li>Heat stress will become an issue for populations in a warming climate.</li>
	<li>Wetter winters will impact on transport infrastructure, e.g. excess waters on roads may cause road hazards.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<ul>
	<li>For all infrastructure, coastal assets in particular, a flood risk assessment should be undertaken examining both exposure to hazard, the resilience of the assets, and the consequences of its failure.</li>
	<li>For critical infrastructure at risk from coastal flooding, coastal protection plans should be put in place.</li>
	<li>Development of future infrastructure should be managed and controlled to avoid areas susceptible to coastal flooding and erosion.</li>
	<li>All new infrastructure should be designed to cope with projected climate, particularly the more extreme events.</li>
	<li>An assessment of climate change risk should be undertaken for existing infrastructure and and a register of all those at risk compiled.</li>
	<li>A review of existing flood defences should be undertaken.</li>
	<li>A review of how energy demands will change under future climate change should be undertaken.</li>
	<li>Review the vulnerabilities of wave and tidal power plants to sea level rise and storm surges.</li>

	<div class="picture right"> 
	<img src="/img/ireland.jpg"/> <br/>Ireland's green image is a key factor in the success of the tourism industry.</div>
	<p>
	The tourism sector is one of the main indigenous driver's of the Irish economy and relies heavily on landscape resources such as mountains, lakes and coasts to attract visitors.  As a result, changes in climate might affect Ireland's most prominent cultural asset, it's landscape and green image, and this may have detrimental consequences for Ireland's tourism industry.  In addition, archaeological  heritage sites, particularly those located on the coast and our inland waterways will be at risk from climate change.  However, increased temperatures and decreased levels of precipitation in summer increase the likelihood of having 'good weather', a key motivation in the choice of holiday destination, and climate change will affect all destinations and the magnitude of change between competing destinations will be a key element in adapting to climate change and maintaining Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness as a tourist destination. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Ireland's tourism sector faces a wide-range of challenges due to climate change.  However and although there are many issues related to tourism and climate change that are difficult to predict, we can be fairly certain that Ireland will not be as badly affected as other destinations around the world.  For example, changes in climate are already affecting the tourism sector in Europe, particularly in the alps where the impact of continuing climate change on the snow-based sports tourism industry in a range of European countries is potentially severe with the key climate change relating to 'natural snow reliability' and also 'technical snow reliability' (i.e. cold enough temperatures to make snow). In contrast, projections indicate that climate change could lead to a gradual shift in tourist destination from areas of southern to northern Europe.  This is due to increasing temperature and the resultant increase in attractiveness of outdoor activities.

	<p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Increased temperatures and drier summers will provide the opportunity for a more prolonged tourist season with an expansion from the present peak tourism months (May-August) into 'shoulder' months of April and September/October.</li> 
	<li>Climate change will result in increasing temperatures and drier weather in the Mediterranean regions and is expected to result in decreased tourist flows to these areas as it becomes uncomfortably hot.  This combined with decreased availability of water will mean a shift away from this region is likely.  This shift will expand into higher latitudes and altitudes.  Consequently, northern European countries, including Ireland, are likely to become more favourable holiday destinations.</li>
	<li>Under these conditions, a higher number of domestic tourists are expected.</li>
	<li>Under projected climate conditions, the diversification of tourism activities is expected including the development of outdoor activities and the expansion of nature-based activities.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
	 
	<li>Water supply in Ireland is designed to cater for the permanent population and it does not take into account increased numbers due to tourist arrivals when populations of small towns (e.g. Killarney) can double over the tourist season.  Climate change will have serious implications for water management and consideration of water infrastructure at pivotal locations to allow for consumption of water across all seasons will be required.</li>
	<li>Water-based activities (e.g. angling and boating) are a primary tourism and recreational activity.  Under a changing climate, there is to be an expected increase in the attractiveness of these activities.  However, climate change will have negative impacts on the quality of water with a greater risk of eutrophication, low flows in water bodies, marine ecosystems and fish stocks may be altered and increased storminess may impact on coastal activities.</li>
	<li>Any impacts on the natural environment such as those posed by climate change are likely to impact on tourism and tourist perception of Ireland.  Ireland's landscape and associated colours rely on Ireland's temperate and precipitous climate and with projected decreases in levels of rainfall, the green landscape associated with Ireland is likely to change.</li>
	<li>Ireland's coastal landscape and it's cultural heritage features, e.g. Martello towers, castles, will be affected by increased coastal erosion, more frequent storms, and rising sea levels.</li>
	<li>Popular tourist routes on the coast are likely to require more frequent maintenance.</li>
	<li>Increased tourist numbers will put pressure on Ireland's already vulnerable natural and cultural heritage assets.</li>
	<li>Changes in riverflow, particularly high flow events which result in flooding, will impact upon archaeological and industrial sites situated along Ireland's inland water ways.</li>
	<li>Increases in the intensity of extreme events will impact upon tourism infrastructure and damage historical buildings resulting in increased maintenance costs.</li>
	<li>Decreased frequency of cold snaps will result in less frost damage to cultural heritage sites.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Reducing existing pressures on natural assets which will likely exacerbate the effects of climate change is an important step.  For example, currently, a significant number of Ireland's watercourses contain excess nutrients and this problem will be exacerbated by projected changes in climate.</li> 
	<li>Sea level rise poses a threat for natural and cultural assets located on the coast, this demands a co-ordinated and national response.</li>
	<li>For built heritage, greater levels of inspection, maintenance and monitoring will be required.  In addition, the installation of flood warning systems and the development of emergency plans to cope with damage caused by flooding and extreme events is required.</li>
	<li>Training will be required for those working in heritage (policy and site specific) to manage the changes that may arise as a result of climate change.</li>
	<li>For the coast, identification of cultural and natural assets at risk is required.  On this basis, decisions to accept certain losses or protect particular sites can be taken.</li>
	<li>Tourism infrastructure will need to be protected and this is particularly the case for infrastructure located on the coast.</li>
	<li>The development of new infrastructure should take into account the projected impacts of climate change and this is particularly the case for coastal infrastructure, e.g. coastal walks.</li>
	<li>Changing climate will offer new opportunities for the tourist sector, product diversification and innovation should be promoted and developed within the industry, e.g. nature tourism.</li>

	<li>In combination with projected increases in evapotranspiration, projected decreases in summer and autumn runoff  will result in reductions in water resources.</li>

	<img src="http://corkpolitics.ie/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/water-pipe.jpg"></br>Projected climatic changes for Ireland will result in decreased levels of water resources and increased competition for available water resources. 
	</div>
	Currently, for Ireland, the majority of drinking water originates (81.8%) from surface waters (i.e. rivers and lakes) with the remainder originating from ground water (10.3%) and springs (7.8%).  Globally, climate change will have serious implications for water management and for Ireland this is particularly the case as under current climatic conditions, demand is projected to be at the limit of projected supply capacity by 2015.  As a result, climate-induced changes on demands and pressures on water resources will need to be effectively and sustainably managed.     
	</p>
	<p>
	For Ireland, projected areas of concern relate to water supply and quality and flood risk.  For summer and autumn, decreased levels of water flow are projected for catchments in Ireland, particularly those located in the east.  As a result, reductions in surface water resources are likely and when combined with increased levels of evapotranspiration, greater losses from surface water resources can be expected and these changes are expected to become more pronounced as the century progresses.  For example, by the end of the century, projections indicate a reduction of up to 70%. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Projected decreases in water flows in summer and autumn will also mean an increased threat from pollution and contamination.  This is because under low water flows, the potential to dilute pollutants and contaminants will be reduced. As a result, if there is less surface water flow, then the concentrations of pollutants or contaminants could increase even if the amount of contamination remains the same. Water quality will also be under threat from increasing temperatures which promote enhanced plant and algal growth, threatening the ecological status of water bodies. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In contrast, for the winter months, projected increases in levels of precipitation, particularly in the  west and northwest of the country will result in increased flood risk.  Not only will the frequency of flooding increase but also the size of floods and as a result while existing flood-prone areas will be affected more often, new areas will also become more vulnerable to flooding.  Moreover, increased rainfall intensity may result in increased levels of nutrient runoff from land surfaces which may lead to problems of surface water quality, eutrophication in particular.  Increased intensities of precipitation may also result in increased levels of soil erosion and subsequent delivery to surface waters.    
	</p>
	<p>
	Under projected climate change, water resources will become depleted both in terms of water supply and quality and this is against a background  of increasing demand due to, amongst others, increased irrigation requirements.  As a result, water supply will have to be carefully and sustainbly managed.  However, there still remains considerable uncertainty surrounding projected changes in precipitation particularly in relation to where water resources will be located and the quantification of these resources.  Nonetheless, the development of a resilient water supply system, one where the difference between the availability of supply and demand is great, has a high resistance to climate change and should form a first step in adapting to the inevitable consequences of climate change. 
	</p>
	</ul>
	<b>Impacts</b>
	<ul>
	<li>For summer and autumn, projected decreases in surface water flows and increased levels of evapotranspiration will mean a decrease in levels of water resources and problems of water supply.</li>
	<li>The locations of significant water resource may change, projections suggest that these are likely to be located in the west of the country.</li> 
	<li>Projected increases in the occurrence of low flows will also have implications for water quality and pollutant contamination and will threaten the ecological status of water bodies</li>
	<li>Periods of reduced river flows will lead to increased sewage treatment costs due to low rates of dilution.</li>
	<li>Increased water temperatures will result in enhanced algal/plant growth and threaten ecological quality of waters.</li>
	<li>Increased rainfall intensity will increase levels of nutrient runoff from land surfaces to water courses leading to problems of water quality, e.g. eutrophication.</li>
	<li>Problems of water quality will lead to increased water treatment costs.</li>
	<li>Frequency of flooding will increase as will intensity of flooding.  This will mean that new areas will be at flood risk and will also put water quality at risk through overland flow of contaminants and pollutants</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<p>
	There still remains considerable uncertainty in relation to projected changes in precipitation and this is particularly the case in terms of spatial patterns of precipitation.  Providing water for Ireland's future population will present many challenges and it is not yet known whether there will be enough water to meet demand and as a result, it is critical that we reduce demand in the future.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>We need to continue research to identify where significant water resources will be located, how these resources can be quantified and protected.</li>
	<li>Groundwater currently supplies only 30% of Ireland's water supplies and it is important to note that 70% of Ireland is underlain by poorly productive bedrock aquifers, i.e. bedrock that is limited in its ability to recharge.  It is important that we continue to examine the potential of groundwaters as sources of potable water.</li>
	<li>The possibilities for storing water in times of plenty to meet demand in the future needs to be examined.</li>
	<li>Issues of water quality decline must be addressed through integrated planning and sound management to ensure sustainable growth without an associated decline in water quality</li>
	<li>Existing and planned water supply systems and infrastructure must be examined in terms of their resilience to climate change.</li>
	<li>Existing and likely future flood risk should be identified and used by planning authorities in preparing development plans, local area plans and individual planning permissions.</li>
	<li>The adequacy of existing and future flood defence should be examined.</li>
