	<b>Climate Change will impact upon all aspects of Ireland's environment, economy and society </b> 
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual sectors will face differing climate change impacts and will also be presented with differing opportunities.  
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>For example:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Agriculture:</b> key projected climate changes include higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, wetter winters and drier summers.  In order to adapt, farmers will have to adopt earlier planting and harvesting dates, lower fertilizer application rates and significant capital investment in irrigation equipment.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Water Management:</b> Projections indicate that climate change will have a significant impact on river flows and water resources. Models indicate that in Ireland, winters will be wetter and summer drier.  However, when showers occur, they are likely to be heavier leading to an increased risk of flooding.  Moreover decreases in summer rainfall coupled with a rise in evapotranspiration will mean that reductions in streamflow are likely, particularly during the summer months.  This will lead to problems of water supply.  Adaptation measures include ensuring that water supply sources and associated infrastructure are sufficiently robust to meet future demand.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>This section details some of the challenges and opportunities that each sector is likely to face, identifies some adaptation options and illustrates these through case study examples.</b>

	<b>Key Climate Information</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Compared to current conditions, <b>average temperatures will increase by 1-3&deg;C by the end of the century</b>.  Projections indicate that for winters, conditions currently experienced along the southwest will spread throughout the country while for summers, the greatest warming will be experienced away from the coast.</li>
	<li>Soil and water temperatures are expected to vary inline with temperature changes.</li>
	<li>Rainfall changes  are more uncertain but <b>wetter winters</b> are likely for most parts of the country and this is particularly the case for the west with increases in rainfall of 20% likely. In contrast, <b>summers are projected to be drier</b> by a similar amount in eastern areas.</li>
	<li>Projections indicate the occurence of <b>slightly fewer but more intense storms.</b></li>
	<li>An <b>increased frequency of heat waves and drought</b> is expected while the <b>occurrence of cold snaps and frost days is expected to decrease.</b></li>
	<li>The <b>duration of the growing season is expected to increase</b> with spring occurring earlier.</li>

	Adaptation to weather conditions has always been part of farm management and to some extent adaptation to climate change follows the same principles as adaptation to short term oscillations in weather conditions.  Nonetheless, climate change is predicted to have a significant impacts on agriculture at a global level but for Ireland, the predicted impacts are less severe and in some cases may provide opportunities for the Irish agricultural sector through increased productivity and the creation of new market opportunities. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The primary concerns for agriculture relate to <b>projected increases in air and soil temperatures</b> but it is likely that the frequency and intensity of <b>extreme weather events</b> and <b>seasonal variations in precipitation patterns</b> will have the most serious consequences for agriculture.  Climatic variations will have consequences for the <b>availability of water resources, pests and diseases and soils leading to significant changes in the conditions for agriculture and livestock production.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Autumn and Spring yields may increase</b> due to higher temperatures.  However, benefits may be offset due to decreased water availability resulting from decreased levels of summer precipitation</li>
	<li>Higher air temperatures may mean <b>shorter housing periods</b> and earlier turnout dates for cattle in some areas and there may be potential to <b>increase livestock production</b>, either as a result of increased yield potential.</li>
	<li>Adverse impacts of climate change elsewhere may <b>create new market opportunities</b></li> 
	<li>Less spring frost will result in <b>less frost damage</b> to spring crops, potential improved conditions for horticulture and less cold stress to animals.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Plant diseases which are currently rare, such as Rhizomania, may occur more frequently</b> and farm animals may suffer more from a range of tick borne pathogens.  <b>Existing problems for cereals</b>, such as septoria, nodurum and Brown Rust <b>may be exacerbated.</b></li>
	<li>Wetter winters will adversely effect the <b>mobility of machinery</b> on fields.</li>
	<li>Wetter winters will affect the <b>timing of planting, manure and fertilizer spreading</b> and result in a higher risk of soil poaching</li>
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may require <b>increased levels of drainage</b> during higher precipitation events.</li>  
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may result in <b>nutrient leaching, pollution and soil erosion</b> impacting upon water resources</li> 
	<li>Drier summers may result in <b>moisture stress</b> and this will mean that irrigation might be required to maintain pasture and some crops, this is particular the case for potatoes which might become uneconomic to grow in the late summer months.</li>
	<li>The projected increased in the frequencies of heat waves may mean that <b>plant and animal systems become stressed</b> resulting in lower productivity in crop and milk yields</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Due to problems of machinery mobility, <b>earlier planting and harvesting dates</b> will need to be adopted</li>
	<li>The risk of reduced water quality due to higher levels of winter precipitation may be addressed through <b>lower levels of fertilizer application</b></li>
	<li>The risk of water-logging during the winter months may be addressed through <b>increased drainage</b>.  Moreover, the <b>conservation of winter rainfall</b> may offset the deficit in supply during the summer months.</li>
	<li><b>Significant investment in irrigation equipment</b> might be required to maintain productivity during the summer months</li>
	<li>Traditional crops such as potatoes may become uneconomic to grow due to irrigation costs and <b>alternative crops</b> may need to be considered</li>

	  Projected climatic changes for Ireland, increasing temperatures and CO<sup>2</sup>, will <b>increase growth rates</b> of Irish forests but increased growth may negatively impact on <b>timber quality</b> and this growth may be limited due to <b>water and nutrient availability</b>, difficulties in establishing forests and increased risk of <b>disease</b>, <b>pathogens</b> and <b>fire</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Forests have developed alongside the naturally changing climate over millennia.  As climate shifted slowly, the natural environment presented few barriers and species and communities could adapt and evolve.  However, the rapid pace of human-induced climate change have overcome species ability to cope and the increased level of commercial afforestation, consisting of exotic conifers and predominately established on marginal or unsuitable lands may mean further adjustment to cope with climate change. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Forestry currently occupies just 10% of the landcover of Ireland, they are young and productive and research suggests that a doubling of forest cover is well within reach.  The management of forestry is a long-term process and forests in Ireland are generally worked on rotation periods (between planting and final harvest) of 40-50 years.  Within this timeframe, climate change is projected to have a significant impact and as a result, introducing and/or adapting management practice that strengthen the ability of forests to withstand the impacts of climate change will be critical.   
	</p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Increasing atmospheric CO<sup>2</sup>, a substrate for plant photosynthesis is thought to increase tree growth.  However, the effects of this are variable and dependent upon a wide range of factors including location and age of forest stock</li>
	<li>Increasing temperatures are expected to increase the length of the growing season and result in increased tree growth.</li>
	
	
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Windthrow.jpg.JPG/320px-Windthrow.jpg.JPG"/> <br/></div>
	Decreased levels of summer rainfall and increased evapotranspiration may result in loss of vigour at some sites.  However, most Irish sites are situated on lands deemed marginal or unsuitable for agriculture and in general, these sites are associated with high water-holding capacity.  None the less, periods of summer drought may be detrimental in the establishment of forests where roots have not yet fully developed.
	</li>
	<li>Under projected climate change for Ireland suggests, the frequency of storms and windiness are expected to increase and these might have a detrimental effect on Irish forests through blowdown, particularly those forests located on relatively exposed sites.
	</li>
	<li>
	Climate change will have an impact upon the spatial and temporal dynamics of pest species, influencing the frequency and consequences of outbreaks and their spatial patterns, size and geographical range.  Projected increases in temperature for Ireland are expected to increase the threat of pathogens while projected decreases in the frequency of cold snaps is expected to decrease die-off of pests. Moreover, insect populations will exploit situations where tress are already stressed due to, amongst others, storm damage, drought or flooding.
	<li>
	Currently, forest fires are relatively infrequent in Irish forests.  Weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind) control the inflammability of Irish forests.  However, a warmer and drier conditions will only increase the risk of forest fire.
	</li>
	<li>
	Certain tree species require frost as part of their growth cycle, projected decreases in the occurrence of frost days may have detrimental effects on these.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<ul>
	<li>In a potentially milder climate with wetter winters, the timing of preparation, planting, harvesting and transport may become critical.</li>  
	<li>Where winters become wetter, due to the use of machinery, it may become necessary to complete all preparatory work prior in the summer and autumn prior to planting in winter.</li>
	<li>With a longer growing season, optimal planting dates may be affected, post planting care may also become critical and this is particularly the case for areas experiencing warmer drier summers which is commonly the cause of tree mortality in newly planted areas. </li>
	<li>Due to the use of heavy machinery, there may be increased pressure to undertake harvesting in drier summer periods.</li>
	<li>Projected climate changes indicate increased temperatures and this would suggest more favourable habitats for insects, pathogens and mammals (e.g. deer).</li>
	<li>Species suitability may change and it is important to consider the planting stock when planning for climate change</li>

	<h2>Coastal Areas</h2></a>
	<div id="text-box">
	<b>Key Information</b>
	<ul>
	<li>By the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, mean sea level is expected to rise by 18 to 59 cm above its current level (IPCC 2007)</li>
	<li>The intensity of coastal storms is projected to increase significantly (IPCC 2007)</li>
	<li>20% of Ireland's coastline is considered at risk with current erosion rates varying from a maximum of about 2 m per year on parts of the east coast to near zero at sheltered locations (Devoy 2008)</li>
	<li>Current total rates of land loss for Ireland from erosion and flooding have been estimated to be approximately 1.6km<sup>2</sup>/year, concentrated at about 300 sites (Devoy 2008)</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>
	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="/img/surge.jpg"/> <br/></div>
	
	Coastal flooding and erosion pose serious threats to Ireland's economy, society and natural environment and this is particularly the case as Ireland's major cities (Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway) are located on the coast. Coastal flooding occurs when high tides, surges and wave-overtopping combine to inundate coastal areas.  Coastal erosion which is intimately linked with coastal flooding occurs when the sea progressively encroaches upon the land.
	</p>
	<p>
	In general, high tides do not occur exactly as predicted and the difference between the predicted normal tide level and the expected sea level is called a surge.  Currently, surges occur frequently and generally past unnoticed.  However, in some cases, such as occurred in Dublin in September 2002 when a 1 metre surge coincided with one of the highest spring tides of the year, there are severe consequential social and economic impacts. With a modest increase in sea levels (40 cm), the frequency of flood events such as occurred in Dublin in February 2002, currently expected to occur once per century, are predicted to increase to once every five years if not more often.  
	</p>
	<p>Climate change projections indicate that mean sea level is expected to rise and this increase is not expected to result in serious inundation of the Irish coast.  However, coupled with the projected increases in  the intensity of coastal storms occurring in winter, wind-driven storm surges will significantly increase the risk of coastal flooding and erosion and this is particularly the case when wind-driven storm surges coincide with a high spring tide.  During these events, significant areas of land can be lost instantaneously.  Projected changes in sea levels are also expected to enlarge the vertical and horizontal extent of estuaries and this will result in the penetration of tides further upstream and this would impede the outflow from rivers.  Coupled with the increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events, this may have serious implications for flooding.  
	</p>
	
	<p>Climate change will impact upon and offer opportunities <b>to all sectors</b> operating in coastal areas and these include agriculture, biodiversity, marine and fisheries, critical infrastructure, and tourism.  Yet, <b>planning and development decisions</b> for coastal areas take place on a <b>sectoral basis</b>.  This fragmented approach to management leads to inefficient use of resources, conflicting claims on space and missed opportunities for adaptation of coastal areas to climate change.  However, projects on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime_spatial_planning/index_en.htm"><b>Marine Spatial Planning</b></a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/home.htm"><b>Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)</b></a> call for a strategic approach to coastal zone planning in order to achieve a more sustainable coast.    
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Increased risk of the physical loss of land, coastal inundation and resulting damage to infrastructure situated along the coast.</li>
	<li> Rising sea levels have the potential to inundate freshwater ecosystems and affect the quality of ground waters.  With projected decreases in summer rainfall, Ireland may become increasingly reliant on groundwater supply and their salinisation may have serious consequences for water supply.</li>
	<li>Projected increases in sea surface temperatures are expected to increase the intensity of cyclones which will result in more extreme storm activity with the potential to bring the devastation of storm surges to the coast of Ireland.</li>
	<li>Sea level rise, increased storminess and wave heights will likely intensify erosion rates and accelerate loss of land.</li>
	<li>In conjunction with increased surface water runoff, particularly due to extreme rainfall events, sea level rise and wind-driven storm surges may result in estuarine and river flooding.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Warming waters may bring additional opportunities for recreation and the <a href="tourism-cultural-heritage">tourism sector</a>.</li>
	<li>Warming waters may also bring opportunities for the <a href="marine-fisheries">fisheries sector</a> as new fish species will likely move from the southerly latitudes following warmer waters.</li>
	<li>For areas subject to coastal erosion, their managed retreat may contribute to ecosystem health and <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.  Managed retreat is generally designed to avoid hazards and prevent ecosystems from being squeezed between development and the advancing sea.  Mechanisms commonly include setbacks that require new development to be a minimum distance from the shore, density restrictions that limit development and rolling easement policies that allow development on condition that it be removed to enable wetlands to migrate landward</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<p>
	Due to the current and fragmented approach to planning and decision-making in coastal areas, adaptation in the coastal zone might be facilitated by taking a strategic approach to planning (e.g. ICZM), incorporating a cross-sector perspective and taking into account both the terrestrial an marine components of the coastal zone.</p> 
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Soft engineering approaches can be taken to reduce coastal erosion and flooding which include beach nourishment, the artificial addition of sediments, and dune rehabilitation, restoring or enhancing natural dune systems.</li>
	<li>Structures, e.g. sea walls, can be built to protect critical infrastructure against coastal flooding and erosion.  However, these structures must take into account potential impacts on <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and on neighbouring coastal ecosystems</li> 
	<li>Planned infrastructure can be designed according to best available information and data and flood-proofed through location above current and projected flood levels</li>
	<li>Restoration or creating new wetland ecosystems along the coast in order to provide natural protection against flooding and erosion</li>
	<li>Regulatory measures, e.g. zoning, can be taken to ensure that development does not take place in areas subject to flooding and buffer zones can be created</li>
	<li>For the key sectors operating in coastal areas, a range of adaptation options are available to address the impacts of and take the opportunities presented by climate change in coastal areas.  Further information can be found by navigating to the respective sectoral information pages</li>

	Increased temperatures and decreased levels of precipitation in summer increase the likelihood of having 'good weather', a key motivation in the choice of holiday destination.  However, a changing climate will also have the potential for negative impacts on Irish tourism and the adoption of appropriate adaptation responses will be critical in taking advantage of our changing climate.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Key Opportunities</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Increased temperatures and drier summers will provide the opportunity for a more prolonged tourist season with expansion from the present peak tourism months (May-August) into 'shoulder' months of April and September/October</li> 
	<li>Climate change will result in increasing temperatures and drier weather in the Mediterranean regions and is expected to result in decreased tourist flows as it becomes uncomfortably hot.  This combined with decreased availability of water will mean a shift away from this region is likely.  This shift will expand into higher latitudes and altitudes.  Consequently, northern European countries, including Ireland, are likely to become more favourable holiday destinations.</li>
	<li>Under these conditions, a higher number of domestic tourists are expected.</li>
	<li>Under projected climate conditions, the diversification of tourism activities is expected including the development of outdoor activities and the expansion of nature-based activities.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<b>Key Impacts</b>
	<p>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Water supply in Ireland is designed to cater for the permanent population and it does not take into account increased numbers due to tourist arrivals when populations of small towns (e.g. Killarney) can double over the tourist season.  Climate change will have serious implications for water management and consideration of water infrastructure at pivotal locations to allow for consumption of water across all seasons will be required.</li>
	<li>Water-based activities (e.g. angling and boating) are a primary tourism and recreational activity.  Under a changing climate, there is to be an expected increase in the attractiveness of these activities.  However, climate change will have negative impacts on the quality of water with a greater risk of eutrophication, low flows in water bodies, marine ecosystems and fish stocks may be altered and increased storminess may impact on coastal activities</li>
	<li>Any impacts on the natural environment such as those posed by climate change are likely to impact on tourism and tourist perception of Ireland.  Ireland's landscape and associated colours rely on Ireland's temperate and precipitous climate and with projected decreases in levels of rainfall, the green landscape associated with Ireland is likely to change</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<b>Adaptation</b>
	<p>Appropriate adaptation response will maximise Ireland's potential for tourism in a changing climate and these adaptation options include both hard and soft measures.  Examples include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Eduction and Training on issues of climate change for Tourism</li>
	<li>Adaptation of destination - climate proofing and retros-fitting</li>
	<li>Changing operating patterns and diversifying activities</li>
