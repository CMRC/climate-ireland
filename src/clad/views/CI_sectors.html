	<h2>Sectoral Adaptation</h2>
	 
	<p>
	Climate change will result in higher temperatures, changes in patterns of precipitation, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events.  This will in turn have implications for all sectors of the Irish economy.

	<p><strong>For example</strong>, projections indicate that climate change will have a significant impact on river flows and water resources. Models indicate that in Ireland, winters will be wetter and summer drier.    Importantly, decreases in summer rainfall coupled with a rise in evapotranspiration will mean that reductions in streamflow are likely, particularly during the summer months.  This will lead to problems of water supply.  Adaptation measures must be developed and implemented that ensure that water supply sources and associated infrastructure are sufficiently robust to meet future demand.

	<li>Globally, <b>atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> are projected to increase</b> from current average levels of 400 ppm to 500 and 600 ppm by the years 2050 and 2100 respectively.  This increase is expected to <b>improve net biomass production of agricultural crops</b>.</li>
	<li>Compared to current conditions, <b>average temperatures will increase by 1-3&deg;C by the end of the century</b>. Soil and water temperatures are expected to vary inline with temperature changes.</li>

	Agriculture is one of Ireland's most important indigenous sectors and accounts for approximately 64% of the total land area of Ireland.  Approximately 80% of the agricultural area is devoted to grass (silage, hay and pasture), 11% is devoted to rough grazing and the remainder is allocated to crop production.  Beef and milk production currently account for around 58% of agricultural output. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Globally, climate change is expected to have severe impacts on agriculture and this is due to two interacting factors.  Firstly, increased levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is generally beneficial to the process of photosynthesis and this would be expected to improve net biomass production of agricultural crops <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  In contrast, climate change is also expected to impact on agricultural productivity negatively through the increased occurrence of drought and excessive temperatures which can lower productivity by decreasing appetite and increasing susceptibility of parasitic diseases <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.   For Ireland and for northern Europe more generally, the impacts of climate change are not expected to be as severe as those predicted for those areas in the southern parts of Europe due to the overall expected decrease in precipitation and water availability <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  Nonetheless, all aspects of agriculture in Ireland will be affected by climate change and the main impacts of climate change result from changes in air and soil temperature, precipitation and extreme events.
	</p>
	<p>
	Agriculture is largely a managed system and adaptation to weather conditions has always been a part of farm management and to some extent adaptation to climate change follows the same principles as adaptation to short term oscillations in weather conditions.  Nonetheless, climate change is predicted to have significant impacts on agriculture globally and for Ireland, although the predicted impacts are less severe and in some cases may provide opportunities for the Irish agricultural sector through increased productivity and the creation of new market opportunities, adaptation is required.  
	</p>
	
	<h3>Key Opportunities</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Autumn and Spring grass yields may increase</b> due to higher temperatures and increased levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.  This will allow livestock farms increase profit by exploiting the increase in grass production and reducing the use of concentrate feed.  However, for the east and southeast of Ireland in particular, benefits may be offset due to decreased water availability resulting from projected decreases in summer rainfall<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Adverse impacts of climate change elsewhere may <b>create new market opportunities</b> for Irish farmers <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span></li> 
	<li>Less spring frost will result in <b>less frost damage</b> to spring crops, potential <b>improved conditions for horticulture</b> and <b>less cold stress to animals <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</b></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Due to <b>decreased levels of summer precipitation</b>, particularly in the east of Ireland, <b>water stress</b> in grass, barley, potato and to a lesser extent maize will occur much more often and may increase the requirement for irrigation.  Growing of the potato may become unviable <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Increased temperatures will result in <b>heat stress</b> for animals and this can <b>lower productivity</b> by decreasing appetite and increasing susceptibility to disease <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>The drying out of soil in response to climate change could result in the deterioration of soil quality</li>
	<li><b>Plant diseases which are currently rare, such as Rhizomania, may occur more frequently</b> and farm animals may suffer more from a range of <b>tick borne pathogens</b>.  <b>Existing problems for cereals</b>, such as septoria, nodurum and Brown Rust <b>may be exacerbated.</b><span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span></li>
	<li><b>Wetter winters</b> will adversely effect the <b>mobility of machinery</b> on fields.  For example, higher rainfall may mean that <b>access to land will be limited to the end of March</b>.  As a result, wetter winters will affect the <b>timing of planting, manure and fertilizer spreading</b> and result in a higher risk of soil poaching.<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span></li>
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may result in <b>nutrient leaching, pollution and soil erosion</b> impacting upon water resources .</li> 
	</ul>

	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Due to problems of machinery mobility, <b>earlier planting and harvesting dates</b> may need to be adopted <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>The <b>risk of reduced water quality</b> due to higher levels of winter precipitation may be addressed through <b>lower levels of fertilizer application.</b></li>
	<li>The risk of water-logging during the winter months may be addressed through <b>increased drainage</b>.  Moreover, the <b>conservation of winter rainfall</b> may offset the deficit in supply during the summer months.</li>
	<li><b>Significant investment in irrigation equipment</b> might be required to maintain productivity during the summer months <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[3]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Traditional crops such as potatoes may become uneconomic to grow due to irrigation costs and <b>alternative crops, e.g. maize,</b> may need to be considered <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>The effects of climate change differ across farm types and regions.  However, all livestock farms could increase profitability by exploiting the increase in grass production <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.

	<p>
	Forests have developed alongside the naturally changing climate over millennia and the growth of trees and forests is highly influenced by climate.  Due to the fact that trees and forests are adapted to their local conditions, changes in climate are likely to impact on their future growth and wood output.  In many regions, where native species are used to establish plantations, care is taken in the selection of seeds to ensure that they match local climatic conditions.  In Ireland where exotic species are used widely, foresters pay attention to site suitability, focusing on soil type and prevailing micro-climate, both of which are heavily influenced by overriding climatic conditions <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.   
	</p>
	
	<p>Projected climatic changes for Ireland, increasing temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in particular, are expected to increase growth rates of Irish forests.  However, increased rates of growth may negatively impact on timber quality for some species, e.g. Sitka Spruce, one of the predominant species in Ireland.  Moreover, this increased growth may be limited by the decreased availability of water in summer, difficulties in establishing forests and increased risk of disease, pathogens and fire <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Forestry currently occupies just 10% of the landcover of Ireland, they are young and productive and research suggests that a doubling of forest cover is well within reach.  The management of forestry is a long-term process and forests in Ireland are generally worked on rotation periods (between planting and final harvest) of 40-50 years.  Within this timeframe, climate change is projected to have a significant impact and as a result, introducing and/or adapting management practise that strengthen the ability of forests to withstand the impacts of climate change will be critical <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.   
	</p>
	<h3>Key Opportunities</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub></b>, a substrate for plant photosynthesis is thought to <b>increase tree growth</b>.  However, the effects of this are variable and dependent upon a wide range of factors including location and age of forest stock <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Increasing temperatures are expected to <b>increase the length of the growing season</b> and result in increased tree growth <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Many species, including Sitka Spruce, are sensitive to frost and  central Ireland is particularly prone to late spring frosts.  Projected decreases in cold snaps may mean that foresters can plant less hardy species <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Decreased levels of summer rainfall</b> and  associated decreases in soil moisture may result in <b>loss of vigour</b> for some species e.g. Sitka spruce, Norway spruce, Japenese larch <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  However, most Irish sites are situated on lands deemed marginal or unsuitable for agriculture and in general, these sites are associated with high water-holding capacity.  Nonetheless, periods of summer drought may be detrimental in the establishment of forests where roots have not yet fully developed <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.
	</li>
	<li>Projected increases in periods of summer drought will cause particular difficulties in the establishment of forests where roots have not yet fully developed <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Under projected climate change for Ireland, the <b>frequency and intensity of storms and windiness are expected to increase</b> and these increases might have a detrimental effect on Irish forests through <b>blowdown</b>, this is particularly the case those forests located on relatively exposed sites <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  Moreover, endemic wind-throw is common on forest sites with high water tables caused by imperfectly drained soils.  This is because in waterlogged soils, oxygen is quickly depleted leading to anaerobic conditions which prevents plant root respiration, causing root death and a reduction in tree stability.  As almost 70% of Irish forests are on soils with a high winter water table, projected increases in windiness and in the occurrence of intense storms increases the likelihood of catastrophic wind-throw <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.
	</li>
	<li>
	The projected warmer climate  and changing rainfall distribution will have a profound impact upon the <b>spatial and temporal dynamics of pest species</b>.  Insects will respond to a warming climate by increasing their rate of development and the number of generations per year.  For example, outbreaks of the green spruce aphid in Ireland has resulted in severe defoliation of spruce plantations.  The aphid population is vulnerable to low winter temperatures so the increasing probability of milder winters will likely result in increased attack<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  In addition, projected decreases in the frequency of cold snaps is expected to decrease die-off of pests <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>. Moreover, insect populations will exploit situations where tress are already stressed due to, amongst others, storm damage, drought or flooding.</li>
	<li>Increasing temperatures will allow pathogens, such as the fungus <i>Dothistroma septosporum</i>, expand their range across Europe and into Ireland <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>
	Currently, forest fires are relatively infrequent in Irish forests.  Weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind) control the inflammability of Irish forests.  However, a <b>warmer and drier conditions will only increase the risk of forest fire <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span></b>.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Certain tree species require frost</b> as part of their growth cycle, projected decreases in the occurrence of frost days may have detrimental effects on these.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>It is important to ensure that the tree species planted now will be suited to changing biophysical site conditions. <b>Species suitability</b> may change and it is <b>important to consider the planting stock</b> when planning for climate change.  For example, a reduction in spruce planting in the South and east has been suggested as these species are considered too drought sensitive while an increase in Douglas fir might be appropriate due to their relatively high levels of tolerance to drought conditions. Moreover, the projected warmer and drier climate may offer the possibility of extending the range of species to those less well represented in Ireland, e.g. projected climatic changes will improve for the southern beech 'rauli' (<i>Nothofagus nervosa</i>) <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Spreading the risk is central to the notion of good management in an unknown or uncertain future.  Silviculture systems should be adopted to spread the risk by considering mixed species and mixed age structure stands <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>. Moreover, Silviculture systems can be employed to protect against projected increases in wind-throw and incidences of pests and diseases through groups and continuous silviculture systems which offer a more protected environment in which to become established <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Projected changes in the incidence of pests and disease will require and regional measures and management plans as they are not practical on a site-by-site basis <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.
	<li>In a potentially milder climate with <b>wetter winters</b>, the <b>timing of preparation, planting, harvesting and transport may become critical</b>.  Currently, tree planting is generally undertaken in the dormant winter season.  Where <b>winters become wetter</b> and due to the use of heavy machinery and inaccessibility to land under wetter winter conditions, it may become necessary to complete <b>all preparatory work</b> in the summer and autumn <b>prior to planting</b> in winter <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>With a longer growing season, <b>optimal planting dates may be affected</b>, post planting care may also become critical and this is particularly the case for areas experiencing warmer drier summers which is commonly the cause of tree mortality in newly planted areas <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>. </li>
	<li>Due to the use of heavy machinery, there may be <b>increased pressure to undertake harvesting in drier summer periods</b> <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</li>

	<p>Biodiversity includes all living organisms found on land and in water and is a term used to describe the variety of life.  The four basic building blocks of biodiversity are genes, species, habitats and ecosystems.  The distribution of wildlife and landscapes are the result of complex interactions.  The basic physical qualities of the rock, soil and climate provide the underlying structure and continuing influence.  The majority of the detail has been shaped through millennia of natural processes and human activity, the history of land use and management and associated impacts <span class="reference"><a href="1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
	

	<ul>
	<li><strong>Genes:</strong> The basic building blocks of life, they determine the characteristics of living organisms.  Maintaining genetic diversity through conservations is a cornerstone of nature conservation;</li>
	<li><strong>Species:</strong> Nearly two million species have been identified worldwide and it is estimated that these may represent only 20% of those currently existing on the earth.  Apart from micro-organisms, insects are the biggest and most varied group.  Other groups include fungi, plants, lichens and mosses;</li>
	<li><strong>Habitats:</strong> Different species of plants and animals come together to form ecological communities in a given area or natural environment called a habitat.  A habitat includes physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature and light and are formed in response to local climate conditions such as soil type and climate.  Human activities however also play a major role in shaping and creating habitats of high biodiversity value, e.g. meadows;</li>
	<li><strong>Ecosystems:</strong> An ecosystem can include one or many different habitats.  Healthy ecosystem help to maintain species and habitats.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>In addition to its intrinsic value, biodiversity provides a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential for using the earth's resources sustainably and they include:</p> 
	
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Provisioning services:</strong> harvestable products such as food, drinking water and raw materials;</li> 
	<li><strong>Regulatory services:</strong> water treatment or slowing the passage of water;</li> 
	<li><strong>Cultural services:</strong> These service directly involve people, e.g. recreation;</li> 
	<li><strong>Habitat or supporting services:</strong> that are needed to maintain other services, e.g. pollination, and which include genetic diversity and maintenance of life cycles <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li>

	<p>Ireland's natural landscape is one of its greatest assets and for its relatively small size, Ireland has a wide diversity of habitats as designated under the EU habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).  Due to Ireland's location on the western edge of Europe, subject to both maritime and continental conditions, the climate of Ireland is typified by spatial and temporal variability and in combination with the effects of physical geography, a locally variable climate across the region results.  This variable climate contributes greatly to biodiversity of Ireland and includes a mix of Atlantic, Arctic, Arctic-alpine and boreal elements occurring within a limited geographical area, and including many species on the edge of their global distribution range <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  Moreover, the value of ecosystem services in Ireland has been estimated at 2.6 billion euro per year <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  This is a provisional figure and is based on only a few key examples and necessarily omits services such as, for example, waste assimilation by aquatic biodiversity and benefits to human health.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Throughout Europe, the rate of habitat degradation and ensuing biodiversity loss is accelerating <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> and for Ireland this is identified as being due to: direct habitat damage such as peat cutting; over grazing and undergrazing; water pollution particularly from nutrients and silt; unsustainable exploitation such as overfishing and peat extraction; invasive alien species; and recreational pressures <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  It is in that this context that the threats and opportunities posed by climate change must be considered.

	<p>
	Climate and biodiversity are inextricably linked and global evidence indicates that species are already being affected by climate change, and studies in Ireland confirm this.  Phenology, the study of the timing of lifecycle events in the animal and plant world as influenced by the environment, has identified that changes in the lifecycle events of plants and birds have already been observed.  For example, on average, observations of leaf unfolding indicate that the growing season in Ireland is beginning earlier and at some sites in the southwest of Ireland by up to 10 days earlier than was the case in the 1970s <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.  This trend is expected to continue into the future.  Importantly, biodiversity can help us to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change in many ways and the protection of biodiversity can help us both mitigate against and adapt to climate change.  For example, protecting biodiversity can help limit greenhouse gas concentrations because forest, peatlands and other habitats are major stores of carbon.  Moreover, healthy ecosystems, e.g. coastal wetlands, can be employed to buffer against coastal erosion.  Therefore, ecosystem approaches should be an integral part of the overall mitigation and adaptation effort <span class="reference"><a href="#7">{7}</a></span>.
	</p>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"><img src="/img/raised-bog.jpg"><figcaption>Raised bogs are one of those habitats considered particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  This is particularly the case as climate change impacts will be superimposed upon an already degraded resources.

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"><img src="/img/bog-burst.jpg"><figcaption>Bog burst at Derrybrien, Co. Galway 2003.  The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events is result in catastrophic damage to habitats in Ireland.
	</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>For Ireland, expected climatic change, increases in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns in particular, will impact upon species behaviour and ecosystem distribution <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.  It is expected that changes in plant response will initially be rather subtle, such as an increase in primary production and changes in species composition.  In the longer term, movement of habitats will be very dependent on human influence on land use, for example, migration of species will be dependent on the availability of suitable migration routes.  Moreover, for the most vulnerable habitats which include Raised Bog, Blanket Bog, Cladium Fens, Petrifying Springs, Turloughs and Bog Woodland, it is expected that climate change impacts will be superimposed on an already poor outlook <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.  As a result, climate change will likely exacerbate these pressures and exert additional pressures such as: changes to the range of many species, changes in species abundances, and changes to the timing of seasonal activity. Climate change, increasing temperatures in particular, is also likely to favour invasive species, leading to new invasions and the likely spread of already established invasive species.  Climate change will interact with invasive species through a variety of mechanisms such as changes in pathways or vectors, habitat alteration increasing vulnerability to invasion and changes in the range of distribution of potential and established invaders.  Rising sea levels and projected changes in storm and wave climate will have implications for coastal habitats while the increased occurrence of extreme events could have catastrophic consequences for all habitat types <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</p>  
	
	<p>A key area for management of and planning for biodiversity is that future climatic shifts could result in changes to species range dynamics.  A changing climate results in forced species migration.  However, the occurrence of impermeable landscapes restricts species movement and prohibits autonomous adaptation.  This decreases the relevance of current conservation strategies which seek to preserve pattern through the designation of fixed protection areas.  These natural/semi-natural areas will remain important but planning must now address biodiversity conservation at a landscape level and plan for interconnectivity between potentially available suitable landscape units and habitats <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<h3>Opportunities</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Bogs and wetlands</b> currently comprise of 15% of Ireland's land area, 8-11% of these remain relatively intact, and these can potentially be <b>employed as carbon stores and sinks.</b> <span class="reference"><a href="#8">[8]</a></span></li>
	<li>Wetland habitats can provide <b>natural flood defences</b> for both coastal and inland areas.</li>
	<li>Properly managed ecosystems can be employed to help <b>reduce and manage soil erosion</b>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Impacts</h3>
	<li> <b>20% of Ireland's total native flora</b> appear to be <b>particularly vulnerable to climate change</b> from the current period to 2050 <span class="reference"><a href="#9">[9]</a></span>.</li>   
	<li><b>Species interactions will be impacted</b> upon by climate change.  For example, milder temperatures and earlier spring weather may mean that young birds do not hatch at the same time as their prey, affecting their ability to reach maturity and survive.</li>
	<li>Changing climate will result in <b>increased occurrences of invasive species and competitive pressure</b> on those species native to Ireland.</li>
	<li>Habitats will need to adapt to climate change, <b>fragmented isolated habitats will be the most vulnerable.</b></li>
	<li><b>Wetland habitats</b> may be damaged due to <b>drying out or erosion</b>, 40% of the suitable climatic areas for peatlands are projected to be lost by 2075 <span class="reference"><a href="#10">[10]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Coastal habitats may be lost due to <b>sea level rise</b>, increased wave heights and occurrences of coastal storms.</li>
	<li><b>Extreme events</b>. may have unpredictable and profound impacts, <b>overwhelming any impacts due to changes in average climatic conditions</b>.</li>
	<li>Increased levels of winter precipitation may result in <b>increased nutrient runoff, affecting water quality and fish survival</b>, and <b>soil erosion</b>, possibly impacting upon salmon and trout spawning areas.</li>
	
	</ul>
	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A primary adaptation strategy to climate change and current variability is to <b>reduce and manage current stresses on species and ecosystems</b> by addressing issues such as habitat fragmentation and destruction, over-exploitation and eutrophication, while keeping the potential impacts of climate change in mind.</li>
	<li>It is of importance to <b>maintain viable, connected and genetically diverse ecosystems</b>, strategic national policies could co-ordinate with communal and private land-use systems to address these issues</li>
	<li>Establishment of <b>diverse agroforestry systems</b> to cope with increased risk from climate change.</li>
	<li><b>Conservation of agro-biodiversity</b> to provide specific gene pools and crops, to enhance the abilities of crop and livestock systems to adapt to climate change at a genetic level.</li>

	<strong>Key Information</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>By the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, <b>mean sea level is expected to rise by 18 to 59 cm</b> above its current level. </li>
	<li>With increased warming of the ocean, the frequency of coastal storms is expected to increase and for future coastal wave climate, areas of deep water inshore and those areas situated on the north-west of Ireland are most likely to experience the greatest <b>increase in future wave heights</b>. </li>

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	  <img src="/img/surge.jpg"/> <figcaption>Under projected climatic change, Ireland's coastal areas will be at increased risk of coastal erosion and flooding.</figcaption></figure>
	 <figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
		<img src="/img/dublin-convention-centre.jpg"/> <figcaption>Many of Ireland's urban centres are located on the coast and estuaries.  Increasing sea levels and wave heights will put these areas at risk.</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Coastal flooding and erosion pose serious threats to Ireland's economy, society and natural environment and this is particularly the case as Ireland's major cities (Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway) are located on the coast. Coastal flooding occurs when high tides, surges and wave-overtopping combine to inundate coastal areas.  Coastal erosion which is intimately linked with coastal flooding occurs when the sea progressively encroaches upon the land.
	</p>
	<p>
	In general, high tides do not occur exactly as predicted and the difference between the predicted normal tide level and the expected sea level is called a surge.  Currently, surges occur frequently and generally pass unnoticed.  However, in some cases, such as occurred in Dublin in September 2002 when a 1 metre surge coincided with one of the highest spring tides of the year, there are severe consequential social and economic impacts. With a modest increase in sea levels (40 cm), the frequency of flood events such as occurred in Dublin in February 2002, currently expected to occur once per century, are predicted to increase to once every five years if not more often <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  
	</p>
	<p>Climate change projections indicate that mean sea level is expected to rise by on average 0.48 m <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>  and this increase would not be expected to result in serious inundation of the Irish coast.  However, coupled with the projected increases in  the intensity of coastal storms occurring in winter, wind-driven storm surges will significantly increase the risk of coastal flooding and erosion and this is particularly the case when wind-driven storm surges coincide with a high spring tide <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span><span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  During these events, significant areas of land can be lost instantaneously.  Projected changes in sea levels are also expected to enlarge the vertical and horizontal extent of estuaries and this will result in the penetration of tides further upstream, impeding the outflow from rivers and resulting in estuarine flooding.  Coupled with the increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events, this may have serious implications for coastal areas <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  
	</p>
	
	<p>Climate change will impact upon and offer opportunities to all sectors operating in coastal areas and these include agriculture, biodiversity, marine and fisheries, critical infrastructure, and tourism.  Yet, planning and development decisions for coastal areas take place on a sectoral basis.  This fragmented approach to management leads to inefficient use of resources, conflicting claims on space and missed opportunities for adaptation of coastal areas to climate change.  However, projects on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime_spatial_planning/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Marine Spatial Planning</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/home.htm" target="_blank">Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)</a> call for a strategic approach to coastal zone planning in order to achieve a more sustainable coast.    
	</p>
	
	<h3>Key Opportunities</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Warming waters may bring additional opportunities for recreation and the <a href="tourism-cultural-heritage" target="_blank">tourism sector</a>.</li>
	<li>Warming waters may also bring opportunities for the <a href="marine-fisheries" target="_blank">fisheries sector</a> as new fish species will likely move from the southerly latitudes following warmer waters.</li>
	<li>For areas subject to coastal erosion, their managed retreat may contribute to ecosystem health and <a href="biodiversity" target="_blank">biodiversity</a>.  Managed retreat is generally designed to avoid hazards and prevent ecosystems from being squeezed between development and the advancing sea.  Mechanisms commonly include setbacks that require new development to be a minimum distance from the shore, density restrictions that limit development and rolling easement policies that allow development on condition that it be removed to enable wetlands to migrate landward.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Projected increases in sea level will result in inundation of coastal areas.  Under a projected sea level rise of 0.5m and not taking into account isostatic-glacial adjustment, it is estimated that 200km<sup>2</sup> of land area in the Republic of Ireland would be at risk of inundation <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  For more information on the impacts of sea level rise for Ireland, click <a href="ci/tools/coastal-flooding" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>Projected <b>increases in sea surface temperatures</b> are expected to increase the intensity of cyclones which will result in <b>more extreme storm activity</b> with the potential to bring the devastation of storm surges to the coast of Ireland.  For Ireland and when compared with the 1961-1900 period, models indicate that for the period 2031-2060, storm surge heights in the range of 50 -100 cm will increase in frequency around all Irish coastal areas with the exception of the south and by up to 20% in the north and west. There is also an increase in extreme storm surge heights along the west and east coasts, with most of the extreme surges occurring in winter <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span></li>
	<li><b>Projected increases in sea level coupled with projected increases in wave heights and storms poses a serious risk for Ireland in terms of physical loss of land, coastal inundation</b> and resulting damage to infrastructure situated along the coast.</li>
	<li> Rising sea levels have the potential to <b>inundate freshwater ecosystems and affect the quality of ground waters</b>.  With projected decreases in summer rainfall, Ireland may become increasingly reliant on groundwater supply and their salinisation may have serious consequences for water supply <span class="reference"><a href="5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Sea level rise will provide a heightened platform for coastal erosion and it has been estimated that sandy coastlines will 'retreat' or lose about 1 m of land, for every 1 cm in sea level rise <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Moreover, projected increases storminess and wave heights will likely <b>intensify erosion rates and accelerate loss of land</b>.</li>
	<li>In conjunction with increased surface water runoff, particularly due to extreme rainfall events, sea level rise and wind-driven storm surges is expected to result in <b>estuarine and river flooding and will pose major problems for coastal cities <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span> </b>.</li> 
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<p>
	Due to the current and fragmented approach to planning and decision-making in coastal areas, <b>adaptation in the coastal zone might be facilitated by taking a strategic approach to planning</b> (e.g. ICZM), incorporating a <b>cross-sector perspective</b> and taking into account both the <b>terrestrial and marine components</b> of the coastal zone.</p> 


	<ul>
	<li><b>Soft engineering approaches</b> can be taken to reduce coastal erosion and flooding which include beach nourishment, the artificial addition of sediments, dune rehabilitation, restoring or enhancing natural dune systems.</li>
	<li><b>Structures</b>, e.g. sea walls, can be built to <b>protect critical infrastructure</b> against coastal flooding and erosion.  However, these structures must take into account potential impacts on <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and on neighbouring coastal ecosystems.</li> 
	<li>Planned infrastructure can be <b>designed according to best available information and data</b> and <b>flood-proofed</b> through location above current and projected flood levels.</li>
	<li><b>Restoration or creating new wetland ecosystems along the coast</b> in order to provide <b>natural protection</b> against flooding and erosion.</li>
	<li><b>Regulatory measures</b>, e.g. zoning, can be taken to <b>ensure that development does not take place in areas subject to flooding</b> and buffer zones can be created.</li>
	<li>For the <b>key sectors</b> operating in coastal areas, <b>a range of adaptation options</b> are available to address the impacts of and take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change in coastal areas.  Further information can be found by navigating to the <b>respective sectoral information pages</b>.</li>

	<p>Ireland's marine ecosystems (i.e. offshore, inshore, coastal)  are home to a rich and diverse range of species and habitats and our oceans are a national asset supporting an important and diverse marine economy.  In 2007, Ireland generated 1.2% of GDP from its marine economy and supported about 1% of the total workforce <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Our marine resources also provide non-commercial benefits such as amenity and biodiversity, as well as important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nutrient dispersal.  However, many believe that we can achieve greater economic return in the areas of seafood, tourism, marine renewable energy and new applications for health, medicine and technology</p> 
	
	<p> 
	 A changing climate has wide ranging implications for Ireland's marine environment and these will impact upon both the fisheries and aquaculture industries. Throughout Europe, sea surface temperatures are increasing and evidence suggests that these changes are already having an affect on the marine environment with a <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/northward-movement-of-zooplankton-between-1958-2005" target="_blank">northward shift in plankton distribution already being observed</a>.  This shift in turn impacts on higher trophic levels, effecting the distributions of species higher up the chain.  However, marine environments represent a wide range of complex and interacting ecosystems and understanding how climate change might affect these remains a key challenge. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For Ireland, key projected climatic changes include: 
	<ul class="small-indent">
	<li>Increased sea surface temperatures and climate induced variations in physico-chemical conditions (e.g. acidification) will have a wide variety of impacts on marine life including species shift and modifications of primary production and food chains.  However, while such changes can be detected scientifically, attributing the particular cause of such responses can be difficult and this is due to the simultaneous impacts from fishing and ecosystem change which can cascade through the food-web via processes of predation and competition <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>;</li> 
	<li>Rising sea levels and the increased occurrence of coastal storm events will impact upon shallow bays and lagoons through high turbidity, scouring and sediment redistribution causing disturbance and mortality amongst sediment communities <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Changing patterns of precipitation may compromise species that move between fresh and marine water environments and extreme weather events may result in habitat alteration.</li>
	<li>Climatic shifts will have implications for both navigation and search and rescue operations.</li>
	</p>
	
	<h3>
	Key Opportunities
	</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Climatic change may make conditions more favourable for some high value species</b>.  For example, species currently present on the south coast of Ireland or in northern France, such as turbot <i>Psetta maxima</i>, and sea bass <i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i> should have increased opportunities to become better established in Ireland <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
	Key Impacts
	</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Warming waters will affect the <b>biogeographical ranges of species distribution</b>, and these include major commercial fish stocks, with likely reductions in the range of some northerly species while southerly species are likely to increase their range northward.  For example, herring and cod, both boreal species existing at the limit of the southerly range in Irish waters and abundances are expected to decrease under climate change <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span></li>

	</div>
	
	<li><b>Warmer waters also support lower levels of dissolved oxygen and provide favourable conditions for the growth of algal blooms</b>.  This will exacerbate the impacts of nutrient runoff from the land and promote eutrophic conditions.  These conditions may also promote the growth of jellyfish populations, potentially causing catastrophic losses in coastal aquaculture and the closure of beaches <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  In addition to algal blooms, warmer waters may promote <b>new types of bacteria and pathogenic viruses</b> which can threaten fish and shellfish populations.</li>
	<li>As a result of increased atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, absorption of this CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean and its reaction with water, carbonic acid is produced and results in decreased levels of pH and a disruption in the capacity of marine waters to support calcifying zooplankton. Acidity levels of European Inshore waters have decreased from 8.2 to 8.1 over the industrial era which corresponds to a 30% increase in ocean acidity <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span> and this trend is replicated in Irish waters<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>. On a European scale, projections indicating further decline to 7.7 or 7.8 by 2100, depending on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>The pattern of salinity in coastal and estuarine waters are a part of the physico-chemical conditions that create vertical density gradients and in turn regulate the distribution of marine species. Projected changes in precipitation patterns and in turn runoff patterns could influence the salinity of Irish waters.  Projected decreases in summer runoff could bring high saline water closer to shore <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Coastal waters serve as nurseries for many pelagic fish species, and also for traditionally harvested shellfish and commercial aquaculture.  Some nursery areas are likely to be inundated through tidal inundation of low lying land.  In addition, erosion of low lying areas may significantly alter water flow regimes in these areas and changing patterns of precipitation and their effects upon levels of river discharge and could <b>alter near shore sediment distributions<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span></li>
	<li><b>Warmer waters will result in more extreme storm activity</b>, bringing high winds and storm surges to the coast of Ireland.  This will <b>place those involved in maritime transport, commercial fisheries and off-shore energy enterprises at risk</b><span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.
	</li>		
	</ul>
	
	<h3>
	Adaptation
	</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The marine environment represents a wide-range of complex interacting ecosystems.  <b>The effects of climate change on these ecosystems remains unclear</b>.  As a result, continued monitoring and research is required to ensure that proper decisions on adaptation are taken.  In addition, better management of the marine environment and coasts is of great importance <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>Diversification of shellfish species through aquaculture in order to reduce the dependency on oyster and mussel cultivation <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span></li>
	<li>An examination should be undertaken of high value species that might extend their range into Irish waters and whose cultivation might become economically feasible either as a supplement or replacement for native species <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a>.</li>

	<p>
	Ireland's critical infrastructure (Energy, transport and communications) are a vital part of Ireland's economic activities and in general represents long-term assets.  Critical infrastructure which guarantees our energy and water supplies and enables the reliable use of road, rail and air transport is vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  Moreover, our critical infrastructure represents a highly interconnected system.  For example, if floods damage our energy supply, all other services can be affected.  As a result, adopting a long-term perspective, which includes accounting for the impacts of climate change, ensures that sound economic choices are made and avoids the risks of revisiting incremental decisions made on the basis of short-term pressures. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Due to ease of access and navigations, most of Ireland's major cities and general infrastructure has been located on the coast or in close proximity to rivers.  As a result, flood risk is of concern and under projected climate change, the risk of coastal and inland flooding will increase significantly and has major economic and social consequences for Irish cities, industry and critical infrastructure.  Moreover, drainage networks, in some cases dating to Victorian times, are at risk and in some cases have already been overwhelmed by recent storms.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Climate change will pose a number of key risks for critical infrastructure assets and these include damage or destruction from extreme events, which climate change may exacerbate, coastal flooding and inundation from sea level rise, changes in patterns of water availability and effect of higher temperature on operating costs <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.
	</p>
	<h4>Energy</h4>
	<p>
	Climate change, such as sea level rise an increased frequency of extreme weather events and changing water and air temperatures will have effects on energy transmission, distribution, generation and demand will pose a challenge to the energy sector as this may result in damage to critical assets, decreased efficiencies in energy generation and also increased demand for extra energy <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  Most of Ireland's power stations, oil refineries and storage facilities are located on the coast and are therefore vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges and higher waves .  Extreme weather events (e.g. storm or floods) are a threat to transmission and distributions networks and generation facilities, particularly flooding.  Moreover, extreme floods may effect dam safety<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Decreased efficiencies are projected for hydro power plants as a result of changes in surface water flows, i.e. decreased summer flows, and increased silting of sediment into reservoirs due to increased erosion <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span> while the projected increases in water temperatures(sea or river) used to cool power thermal plants will result in decreased plant efficiencies<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  The energy sector will also face an increasing demand for energy as a result of the increased requirement for air conditioning, pumping of water for water supply, wastewater disposal and irrigation.  In contrast, energy demand may decrease in winter due to decreasing temperatures. Climate change will also offer opportunities for the energy sector particularly in the area of renewable energy generation <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.

	</figcaption></figure>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Transport and Communication</h4>
	<p>
	Transport  and communication networks are also at risk from projected changes in climate, particularly sea level rise, increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns (snow and rainfall) and the increased occurrence and intensity of extreme events (wind storms and heat waves)<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  Road and rail networks will be particular vulnerable especially when following coastal and river valley routes.  Cuttings and embankments will require alteration to cope with increased flooding <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1],</a></span>.Heat stress on communication networks, the thermal expansion of road and rail, poses a threat but should not become an issue for a projected 3&deg;C change in temperature.  In contrast, heat waves have caused heat stress on public transport for many cities <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  Wetter winters, particularly when flooding occurs will impact on transport infrastructure resulting in dangerous road conditions and decreased levels of comfort.  The increased frequency of extreme weather will have major effects on transport and communications resulting in storm damage to infrastructure and service disruption as a result of blocked/damaged transport networks<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  Ships and transport are also at risk due to increased wave heights and risk of storm surge<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.   
	</p>
	<h3>Opportunities</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Currently, Ireland is highly dependent upon imported fossil fuels over long distance yet Ireland's location provides a <b>favourable setting for the generation of renewable energy</b>, e.g. wind and wave energy and this potential is expected to increase in the future.  Moreover, the potential for the <b>generation of solar power will increase</b> under projected climatic changes <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span></li>
	<li><b>Less snow and ice</b> in winter will lead to <b>fewer disruptions</b>, decreased levels of frost/ice damage and decreased requirements for gritting <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</li>

	</ul>
	<h3>Impacts</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Increasing areas of land will become susceptible to flooding (coastal and inland)</b> resulting in damage and disruption to critical infrastructure, particularly those located on the coast and in river valleys, <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> while increased levels of coastal erosion</b> may result in the <b>re-routing</b> of transport and communication networks.</li>
	<li><b>Extreme weather</b> events pose a <b>significant risk</b> to all critical assets.  For example, in the electricity sector, extreme floods</b> will affect <b>dam safety</b> while extreme winds</b> will damage <b>overhead powerlines</b><span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Decreased surface water flows in summer and increased flows in winter will impact upon the <b>efficiencies of hydro-power generation</b> while increased temperatures of surface waters</b> used to cool thermal power plants will result in <b>decreased levels of efficiency</b><span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>The <b>energy sector will face increased levels of demand</b> due to increased energy requirements for air conditioning, pumping of water, wastewater disposal and irrigation <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1].</li>
	<li>Increased potential for <b>damages to wave and tide systems</b> as a <b>result of increased sea levels and storm surge</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Heat stress</b> will become an issue for populations in a warming climate.</li>
	<li><b>Wetter winters will impact on transport infrastructure</b>, e.g. excess waters on roads may cause road hazards.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>All new infrastructure should be designed to cope with the changing weather parameters and the more severe events expected with climate change. For example, electricity infrastructure generally can have a lead time from planning to operation of 10 to years and as a result, projections of energy demand and supply must take into account climate change in addition to socio-economic factors.  Moreover, development of infrastructure should be managed and controlled to avoid areas susceptible to coastal flooding and erosion<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>For all critical infrastructure</b>, coastal assets in particular, a <b>flood risk assessment</b> should be undertaken examining both exposure to hazard, the resilience of the assets, and the consequences of its failure.  For critical infrastructure at risk from coastal flooding, <b>coastal protection plans</b> should be put in place <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1].</li>
	<li>An <b>assessment of climate change risk</b> should be undertaken for <b>existing infrastructure including flood defences, and and a register of all those at risk compiled</b><span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1].</li>
	<li>A <b>review of how energy demands will change</b> under future climate change should be undertaken <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1].</li>

Projections indicate that for summer and autumn in the future, the climate of Ireland will make it a more attractive tourist destination <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.
	</figure>
	<p>
	Climate defines the length and quality of the tourist season, affects tourism operations (e.g. water supply and quality, heating and cooling costs) and influences the environmental conditions that attracts and deters tourists.  As a result of the integrated effects of climate change on tourism, the sector is considered to be highly climate sensitive <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  For the global tourism industry, climate change will bring both risks than opportunities.  However, climate change will affect all destinations differently and the magnitude of change between competing destinations will be a key element in adapting to climate change and maintaining competitiveness and attractiveness as a tourist destination. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The tourism sector is a significant contributer to the Irish economy, both domestically and as a major source of foreign earnings.  The sector depends heavily on cultural and natural heritage and faces a wide-range of challenges due to climate change.  However and although there are many issues related to tourism and climate change that are difficult to predict, we can be fairly certain that Ireland will not be as badly affected as other destinations around the world.  For example, currently, climatic suitability for general tourism activities is currently best in southern Europe.  However, projections of the Tourism Climate Index (TCI), a composite measure for systematically assessing the climatic elements that are most relevant to the quality of the tourism experience for the average summer tourist, indicate that the regions most favourable for tourism will shift north under climate change and the touristic attractiveness of northern and central Europe would increase for all seasons<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Moreover, projections indicate that international arrivals to Ireland are projected to increase continuously over the century, reaching saturation around the 2080s <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  Moreover, in a study conducted by the Deutsche Bank in 2008, it is suggested that Ireland might be one of the 'star' tourist destinations in the future and will benefit overall in comparison to other European destination.  Ireland will however also face many challenges <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently, climate is not a key factor in tourist choice of Ireland as their holiday destination . Nonetheless, while climate is not a notable factor in the choice of Ireland as a holiday destination, weather can impact on visitors satisfaction once they are here <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  Changes in climate will provide a number of opportunities for the tourism industry in Ireland.  Projections indicate a more reliable summer season for Ireland with increased temperatures and decreased levels of precipitation and this will increase the likelihood of having 'good weather'.  The chance of 'good weather' is a key motivation in the choice of holiday destination <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  In addition, as the century progresses, it is likely that the traditional tourist season (May to August) will be prolonged into the shoulder months of April, September and October.  Moreover, the increased likelihood of good weather will also allow for a diversification of the tourist industry including the further development of outdoor activities, the expansion of nature-based destinations and the establishment of a continental style cafe culture <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.   
	</p>
	<figure style="float:left; clear:left">
	<img src="/img/ireland.jpg"><figcaption>Ireland's 'green image' is a key attraction for tourists.</figcaption></figure>
	<p>
	However, climate change is also expected to impact detrimentally on the Irish tourist industry.  Although climate is not the primary reason that tourists come to Ireland, changes in climate might affect Ireland's most prominent cultural asset, it's landscape and green image.  For example in 2011, 85% of overseas holiday makers cited 'beautiful scenery' as a key factor in their decision to visit Ireland <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.  Moreover, this lushness greenness of Ireland's landscape results from the dominance of grass and arable crops as the primary landcover.    Increasing temperatures and reduced levels of precipitation will threaten this green image and summers like that of 1995 where the grass turned brown are likely to occur more frequently<span class="reference"><a href="#8">[8]</a></span>. In addition, and importantly, our coastal landscape will be most risk from transformation of climate change.  While hard coastal areas such as the Cliffs of Moher will remain unchanged, soft coastal areas will be particularly vulnerable and these include the soft boulder coasts of south Counties Down, Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford, where retreat is currently occurring at the fastest retreat.  Even the south and west, however, low-lying bays and estuaries, such as Tralee Bay, Cork Harbour, Clew Bay and especially the Shannon estuary will be at risk of of increased flooding due to sea level rise. Climatic changes will put tourist infrastructure and attractions will also be at risk of temporary extremes of weather and well as the consequences of more gradual climate change.  For example, a rise in sea level and increased coastal erosion will threaten the survival of many coastal sites of interest (e.g. archaeological sites) while those situated on our inland waterways will be at risk from amongst others flash flooding events <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  broadly, climate change will result in water management issues for Ireland with reductions in annual and in eastern areas in particular. Moreover, in summer, the peak tourist season, the provision of water for the tourism industry which is highly dependent on a reliable water supply may also be compromised.  Greatest reductions are projected for the east of Ireland and the Dublin region which ranks as the most visited tourist region in Ireland.  The tourism industry will also face increased competition for available water supply due to, amongst other, the increased irrigation requirements of the agricultural sector.  Moreover, increased usage of water and climate impacts on water quality may result in problems of eutrophication, low water flows and the alteration of marine and freshwater activities which may also impact upon the attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.   
	</p>
	
	<h3>Key Opportunities</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Increased temperatures and drier summers</b> will provide the opportunity for <b>a more prolonged tourist season</b> with an expansion from the present peak tourism months (May-August) into 'shoulder' months of April and September/October <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>Climate change will result in <b>increasing temperatures and drier weather in the Mediterranean regions and is expected to result in decreased tourist flows to these areas</b> as it becomes uncomfortably hot.  This combined with decreased availability of water will mean a shift away from this region is likely.  This shift will expand into higher latitudes and altitudes.  <b>Consequently, northern European countries, including Ireland, are likely to become more favourable holiday destinations</b><span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Projected climate conditions is expected to allow for the <b>diversification of tourism activities</b>, including the development of outdoor activities and the expansion of nature-based activities <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Any impacts on the natural environment such as those posed by climate change are likely to impact on tourism and tourist perception of Ireland.  Ireland's landscape and associated colours rely on Ireland's temperate and precipitous climate and with projected increases in temperatures and changes in decreases in patterns of rainfall, <b>the green landscape associated with Ireland is likely to change</b><span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Ireland's <b>coastal landscape and it's cultural heritage features</b>, e.g. Martello towers, castles, will be affected by <b>increased coastal erosion, more frequent storms, and rising sea levels</b>.  Popular <b>tourist routes on the coast</b> are likely to require <b>more frequent maintenance</b>.<span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span></li>
	<li>Changes in riverflow, particularly high flow events which result in <b>flooding</b>, will impact upon <b>archaeological and industrial sites situated along Ireland's inland water ways</b>.  Moreover, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events</b> will impact upon tourism infrastructure and damage historical buildings resulting in increased maintenance costs<span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Water supply in Ireland is designed to cater for the permanent population and it does not take into account increased numbers due to tourist arrivals when populations of small towns (e.g. Killarney) can double over the tourist season.  Climate change will have <b>serious implications for water management</b> and consideration of water infrastructure at pivotal locations to allow for consumption of water across all seasons will be required <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Water-based activities (e.g. angling and boating) are a primary tourism and recreational activity</b>.  Under a changing climate, there is to be an expected increase in the attractiveness of these activities.  However, <b>climate change will have negative impacts on the quality of water</b> with a greater risk of eutrophication, low flows in water bodies, marine ecosystems and fish stocks may be altered and increased storminess may impact on coastal activities <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Increased fluctuations in temperature and moisture will result in the increased decay of the building fabric of cultural heritage sites and will result in increased maintenance costs.  However, decreased frequency of cold snaps will result in <b>less frost damage</b> to cultural heritage sites.<span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span></li>
	<li>Projected increases in tourist numbers will put <b>pressure on Ireland's already vulnerable natural and cultural heritage assets</b><span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Changing climate will offer new opportunities for the tourist sector, <b>product diversification and innovation should be promoted and developed within the industry, e.g. nature tourism <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</b></li>
	<li>Ireland's landscape is a key tourist attraction and there is a need to recognise the tourism value of the landscape and the threat from climate change on this landscape be placed at the heart of a National Landscape Strategy.  Conservation of landscape character should be linked to sustainable land user and sustainable rural communities <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</li>  
	<li>Tourism <b>infrastructure will need to be protected</b> and this is <b>particularly the case for infrastructure located on the coast</b>.  For the <b>coast, identification of cultural and natural assets at risk is required</b>.  On this basis, decisions to accept certain losses or protect particular sites can be taken.  Moreover, the development of <b>new infrastructure</b> should take into account the <b>projected impacts of climate change</b> and this is particularly the case for coastal infrastructure, e.g. coastal walks <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Sea level rise</b> poses a threat for natural and cultural assets located on the coast, this demands <b>a co-ordinated and national response</b>.  Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) would provide a co-ordinated approach to the management of the coastal zone, integrating the natural, built and tourism assets of the coastline <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Reducing existing pressures</b> on natural assets which will likely exacerbate the effects of climate change is an important step.  For example, currently, a significant number of Ireland's watercourses contain excess nutrients and this problem will be exacerbated by projected changes in climate <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>For built heritage, <b>greater levels of inspection, maintenance and monitoring</b> will be required.  In addition, the <b>installation of flood warning systems and the development of emergency plans</b> to cope with damage caused by flooding and extreme events is required.  Moreover, training will be required for those working in heritage</b> (policy and site specific) to manage the changes that may arise as a result of climate change <span class="reference"><a href="#?">[Stack]</a></span>.</li>

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right">
	<img src="/img/irrigation.jpg"><figcaption>projected climate change will put increasing demand on water resources.  Projected increases in summer temperatures and decreases in rainfall may mean that irrigation will be required for agriculture. 
	</figcaption></figure>
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right">
	<img src="/img/eutrophication.jpg"><figcaption>Current water quality problems for Ireland may be exacerbated by climate change.  For example, increased nutrient runoff due to high intensity rainfall events may result in increased levels of eutrophication of Ireland's freshwaters. 
	</figcaption></figure>
	<p>Currently, for Ireland, the majority of drinking water originates (81.9%) from surface waters (i.e. rivers and lakes) with the remainder originating from ground water (10.5%) and springs (7.6%)<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Globally, climate change will have serious implications for water management and for Ireland this is particularly the case as under current climatic conditions, demand in Dublin is projected to be at the limit of projected supply capacity by 2015 <span class+"reference"><a href="#?">[?]</a></span>.  As a result, climate-induced changes on demands and pressures on water resources will need to be effectively and sustainably managed.     
	</p>
	<p>
	For Ireland, projected areas of concern relate to water supply and quality and flood risk.  For summer and autumn, decreased levels  precipitation are expected to result in decreased surface water flows for catchments in Ireland, particularly those located in the east<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  As a result, reductions in surface water resources are likely and when combined with increased levels of evapotranspiration, greater losses from surface water resources can be expected and these changes are expected to become more pronounced as the century progresses.  For example, by the end of the century, some projections indicate a reduction of up to 70% in the Boyne by the end of the century<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Climate change may also serve to exacerbate existing pressures on water resources, e.g. pollution and contamination.  Projected decreases in water flows in summer and autumn will result in an increased threat from pollution and contamination.  This is because under low water flows, the potential to dilute pollutants and contaminants will be reduced. As a result, if there is less surface water flow, then the concentrations of pollutants or contaminants will increase even if the amount of contamination remains the same. Water quality will also be under threat from increasing temperatures which promote enhanced plant and algal growth, threatening the ecological status of water bodies. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In contrast, for the winter months, projected increases in levels of precipitation, particularly in the  west and northwest of the country will result in increased flood risk <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  For example, the return period of the more extreme and currently rare events such as that expected on the river Barrow once every 50 years under current climatic conditions is expected to occur on average once every 18 years by mid century <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  Not only will the frequency of flooding increase but also the size of floods and as a result while existing flood-prone areas will be affected more often, new areas will also become more vulnerable to flooding.  Moreover, increased rainfall intensity may result in increased levels of nutrient runoff from land surfaces which may lead to problems of surface water quality, eutrophication in particular.  Increased intensities of precipitation may also result in increased levels of soil erosion and subsequent delivery to surface waters.    
	</p>
	<p>
	Under projected climate change, water resources will become depleted both in terms of water supply and quality and this is against a background  of increasing demand due to, amongst others, increased irrigation requirements.  As a result, water supply will have to be carefully and sustainably managed.  However, there still remains considerable uncertainty surrounding projected changes in precipitation particularly in relation to where water resources will be located and the quantification of these resources.  Nonetheless, the development of a resilient water supply system, one where the difference between the availability of supply and demand is great, has a high resistance to climate change and should form a first step in adapting to the inevitable consequences of climate change .   
	</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>Impacts</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>For summer and autumn, <b>projected decreases in surface water flows and increased levels of evapotranspiration</b> will mean a <b>decrease in levels of water resources and may lead to problems of water supply</b><span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Frequency of flooding will increase as will intensity of flooding</b><span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  This will mean that new areas will be at flood risk and will also put water quality at risk through overland flow of contaminants and pollutants</li>
	<li>The <b>locations of significant water resource may change</b>, projections suggest that these are likely to be located in the west of the country and this in contrast to projected distributions of population <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.</li> 
	<li>Projected <b>increases in the occurrence of low flows</b> will also have <b>implications for water quality and pollutant contamination</b>, threatening the <b>ecological status</b> of water bodies.  Moreover, periods of reduced river flows will lead to <b>increased sewage treatment costs due to low rates of dilution</b>.  In contrast, increased rainfall intensity</b> may increase levels of <b>nutrient runoff</b> from land surfaces to water courses leading to <b>problems of water quality</b>, e.g. eutrophication.  In addition, increased water temperatures</b> will result in <b>enhanced algal/plant growth</b> and threaten ecological quality of waters.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Adaptation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>
	There still remains <b>considerable uncertainty in relation to projected changes in precipitation and this is particularly the case in terms of spatial patterns of precipitation</b>.  Providing water for Ireland's future population will present many challenges and it is not yet known whether there will be enough water to meet demand and as a result, <b>it is critical that we reduce demand in the future</b>.  Moreover, we need to <b>continue research to identify where significant water resources will be located</b>, how these resources can be quantified and protected. <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.
	</li>
	<li>Due to the uncertainties, water infrastructure, including the design of flood defences must be flexible so that they can be adapted in the future as new information becomes available <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.  Moreover, one of the main priorities is to ensure that water supply sources and associated infrastructure are sufficiently robust to meet future demands, given the increased sensitivity and duration of low flows <span class="reference"><a href="#8">[8]</a></span>. .</li>
	<li>The <b>adequacy of existing and future flood defence should be examined</b> in the context of expected climate changes and the expectation of more frequent floods that are of a larger magnitude than at present<b>.  Existing and likely future flood risk should be identified</b> and used by planning authorities in preparing development plans, local area plans and individual planning permissions<span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a><a href="#8">[8]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Groundwater currently supplies only 30% of Ireland's water supplies and it is important to note that 70% of Ireland is underlain by poorly productive bedrock aquifers, i.e. bedrock that is limited in its ability to recharge.  It is important that we <b>continue to examine the potential of groundwaters as sources of potable water</b> .  Moreover, the possibilities for <b>storing water in times of plenty</b> to meet demand in the future needs to be examined<span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Issues of <b>water quality</b> decline as a result of an increased frequency of low flows, growing rates of abstraction and increased volumes of sewage from rapidly growing urban centres must be addressed through <b>integrated planning and sound management to ensure sustainable growth</b> without an associated decline in water quality<span class="reference"><a href="#8">[8]</a></span></li>
	<li>Currently, water usage in Ireland is significantly higher than elsewhere in Europe.  projected changes in climate and increases in population could result in significant water shortages in the medium to long-term.  As a result, incentives and regulations are required to managed demand <span class="reference"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>.</li>
