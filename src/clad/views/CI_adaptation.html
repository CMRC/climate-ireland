    <h2>Climate Adaptation</h2></a>
    
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Climate is changing and without taking appropriate actions to address the impacts and take advantage of opportunities presented by these changes, potentially disastrous consequences can be expected.  <a href="#mitigation-and-adaptation">Mitigation and adaptation</a> describe the various ways and techniques to tackle climate change.  Mitigation refers to ours efforts to tackle the causes of climate change while adaptation is about adjusting the way we do things to ensure that we are prepared for climate change.  Continuing mitigation efforts will reduce the need for adaptation. However, due to our long history of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation is now required.</p> 
	
	
    </p>
	
	<a id="mitigation-and-adaptation">
	<h3>Mitigation and Adaptation</h3>
	
	<div class="picture right"> 
	<img src="/img/mitigation-adaptation.jpg"/> <br/>Mitigation actions result in decreased levels of greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing the extent of future climate change.  However, due to greenhouse gases already emitted, climate change and its affects are inevitable.  Adaptation actions aim to reduce the impacts of climate change and also to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change</div>
	
	<div class="picture right"> 
	<img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg"/> <br/>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the effects of a climate hazard.  Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</div>
	
	<h4>Mitigation</h4>
	<p>
	Mitigation refers to actions that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving climate change; it includes reducing activities that give rise to emissions of greenhouse gases and enhance sinks for greenhouse gases in the forests and biosphere.  However, greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so even if we were to stop emitting them tomorrow, the climatic effects of these emissions would stay with us for the foreseeable future. To further compound the inevitability of climate change impacts, a long and slow process of warming of the Earth's oceans has been underway for many decades, a process that will ensure temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise throughout the century.  As a result, regardless of our efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation actions are now essential in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Adaptation</h4>
    <p>
    In their fourth Assessment Report, <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">the IPCC</a> (2007) defines adaptation as: "adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities".  Illustrating the flexibility with which its aims and objectives might be defined, adaptation has also been described as "the adjustment or preparation of natural or human systems to a new or changing environment, with the aim of moderating harm or exploiting beneficial opportunities" <span class="reference">[4]</span>. Therefore, the aim of adaptation is to reduce society's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change by anticipating changes in climatic conditions and the effects of these changes.  Where adaptation efforts fall short, vulnerabilities are exacerbated.  In this context, the IPCC define vulnerability as "the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes" (IPCC 2007).

      <h2>Why Adapt?</h2></a>
    
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
    
	Irrespective of the level of mitigation we are able to enact,  climate change will have both direct and indirect effects on all aspects of Ireland's economy, society, and environment.  Adaptation is necessary to avoid or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and to explore any potential benefits that might be exploited.  As a result, regardless of uncertainties associated with future climate, a 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option.  Moreover, it has now been recognised that adaptation is an immediate need and there is now a clear policy mandate for adaptation to be incorporated into spatial planning practices in Ireland.</p>
    
    <p>
	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="/img/Ireland-snow.jpg"/> <br/></div>
    
	
	<h3>A 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option</h3>
	
	<p>It is now clear that climate is changing and that these changes will continue and intensify in the future.  Although there are uncertainties about our knowledge of future climate, and the specific local impacts of climate change, a wait-and-see approach is not an option given the severity of teh risks posed by climate change.
	</p>	
	<p>Human and natural systems will adapt to climate change autonomously to some degree.  However, planned adaptation which involves decisions and measures within society to respond to the adverse impacts and opportunities presented by climate change is essential if an unacceptable level of risk is to be avoided. Adaptation decisions, particularly those with long-term implications, need to be made now on the basis of the best available, albeit to some extent incomplete information.  This will involve drawing on approaches to strategy formulation that are both prudent and robust to uncertainty.  Being prepared for these changes is important and will help to reduce uncertainty, and the costs that climate change will pose.  We can act to limit the potential impacts of climate change by identifying risks, evaluating options and starting the adaptation process early enough to ensure that as many alternatives as possible remain available to us.  Moreover, well-planned, pro-active adaptation will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change and avoid incurring the worst of the considerable costs that climate change may impose in the absence of appropriate action.</p>
	
	<h3>Legislative requirement</h3>
	<p>Through the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, the Irish Government has recognised that climate adaptation is required to offset the worst consequences of climate change and take advantage of any opportunities that a changing climate might bring.  Moreover, the Irish Government recognises the importance of a strategic approach to climate change, and the critical importance of planning and development measures in delivering it.</p> 
	
	<p>The National Climate Change Adaptation Framework requires that adaptation plans are developed for the key sectors of the Irish economy and that local authorities take a proactive approach to climate change, integrating climate adaptation in the development of relevant policies, plans and programmes, and where necessary, retrospectively assessing plans recently enacted for the fitness of their handling of climate adaptation.</p>

	<h3>Successful Adaptation</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently, a large evidence base on what constitutes good/successful adaptation is lacking.  Nevertheless, to avoid mal-adaptation, adaptation efforts should at minimum endeavour to avoid those pitfalls of adaptation which have already been identified, including:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Measures that increase greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
	<li>Measures that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable groups in society;</li>
	<li>Measures that come with high opportunity costs (social, economic and environmental) in comparison with alternatives;</li>
	<li>Measures that reduce the incentive for actors to adapt, e.g. by increasing the reliance of actors on others actions;</li>
	<li>Measures that create a path dependency, i.e. that adopt trajectories which are difficult to change in the future due to high costs involved in such change.</li>
	</ul>
	
   <p>Moreover, successful adaptation does not mean that the negative impacts of climate change will not occur, only that they will be less severe than had no adaptation taken place.  On this basis, 
    the goals of adaptation might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alleviating the current impacts of climate change;</li>
      <li>Reducing sensitivity and exposure to future climate change;</li>
      <li>Increasing the resilience to climate and non-climatic stressors;</li>
	  <li>Identifying opportunities to exploit any benefits that might accompany a changing climate.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div id="adaptation-actions">
  <a name="Adaptation Actions">
	<h2>Adaptation Types</h2></a>
	
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation aims to reduce climate vulnerability to an acceptable level and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.  Adaptation actions can be classified according to a number of criteria including:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>the driver/impetus that prompts adaptation action;</li> 
	<li>the approach to adaptation;</li>
	<li>the strategies or measures that are employed in commencing and implementing adaptation;</li> 
	</li> 
	
	<p>However, in practice, adaptation involves a mixture of measures and responses.</p>
	
	<a id="adaptation-driver">
	<div id="Adaptation-Driver">
	<h3>Adaptation Drivers</h3>
	
	<h4>Anticipatory and Reactive Adaptation</h4>
	<p>Depending on the timing, goal and motivation,implementation of adaptation can be either reactive or anticipatory.  Reactive adaptation occurs after the initial impact of climate change becomes evident, while anticipatory adaptation occurs before the impacts of climate change are obvious and is sometimes referred to as proactive adaptation.  Adaptation in natural systems is typically reactive, occurring in response to climatic stress.  For example, as a result of warming of teh ocean in high latitudes, commercially valued fish species such as Mackeral have migrated north to Icelandic waters in large numbers.  In contrast, adaptation in human systems can be both anticipatory and reactive.  Anticipatory adaptation might be implemented in order to cope with the projected impacts of climatic change.</p>
	
	<div class="picture">
	<img src="/img/Adaptation_Matrix.png">
	</br>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Autonomous and Planned Adaptation</h4>
	<p>Autonomous adaptation is generally taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances.  These adaptations are often triggered by market or welfare changes that are induced by actual or anticipated climate change. To date many adaptation actions have been both autonomous and reactive.  For example, many adaptive actions can be taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances due to experiences or perceptions of climate risk.  These autonomous adjustments can be beneficial and can often take place without policy intervention.  However, autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal as there will be missed efficiency gains that would accrue from concerted actions.  Moreover, autonomous adaptation in one sector may have adverse effects on another sector, resulting in maladaptation, which occurs when an adaptation action results in an increase rather than a decrease in overall vulnerability to climate change impacts.  In addition, many adaptive actions have been reactive, for example, by taking place after an extreme weather event has occurred.</p>  
	
	<p>In contrast to autonomous adaptation, and given the increasing knowledge of climate change impacts, there is now an impetus to develop adaptation actions through proactive planning so that we are better placed to deal with future events.  By anticipating and planning for climate change impacts, it is possible to reduce the costs and maximise the effectiveness of adaptation actions.  The type and scale of planned adaptation responses are determined both by the vulnerability of a given system to climate change impacts, and its inherent capability to adapt, or 'adaptive capacity'.  Adaptation actions should aim to address climate change impacts and also increase 'adaptive capacity'. As a result, in order to plan effectively for adaptation, a number of building blocks need to be in place to aid a comprehensive and coherent national adaptation response:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><b>A robust knowledge base</b> - a clear understanding of expected exposure to climate change and the sensitivity of sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations and consequential potential impacts</li>
	<li><b>An assessment of adaptive capacity</b></li>
	<li><b>A vulnerability assessment</b></li>
	<li><b>Identification of adaptation requirements and the associated options, together with an estimation of costs and benefits</b></li>
	<li><b>An action plan</b></li>
	<li><b>A review mechanism</b></li>
	</ol>
	 
	 <a id="adaptation-approaches">
	<h3>Approaches to Adaptation</h3>
	 
	<h4>'Top-down' and 'Bottom-up' Approaches</h4>
	<p>Until recently, approaches to adaptation have been based on a standard impact-orientated, command and control (or 'top-down') approach.  This approach begins with simulated climate scenarios, generally downscaled to a regional basis, that are then applied to a specific target or unit, e.g. local area or watershed, through impact modelling.  Impacts on that unit are then estimated and on this basis, adaptation measures are then identified and evaluated.  While these studies have made significant contributions to the theoretical understanding of climate change, there are a number of criticisms to this approach and these include:</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>The scenarios employed are generally simplified versions of the locality under consideration</li>
	<li>The approach focuses on future climate.  As a result, it tries to address how uncertain impacts can be reduced by the process of adaptation unknown future socio-economic circumstances.</li>
	<li>The top-down approach often lacks sound damage estimates, which also fail to account for welfare effects or consideration of adaptive capacity.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In contrast to the 'top-down' approach, the 'bottom-up' approach to climate change is applied at the local scale, utilising a participatory approach.  The bottom-up approach first employs assessments of vulnerability to current climate variability and extremes, including an assessment of current adaptation strategies, policies and measures based on actual experience at different scales.  On this basis, the dimensions of new risks can the be assessed in the context of current knowledge and experience and can include information on broader changes (including demographic and socio-economic processes) as well as direct and indirect climate-related risks such as changing pests and diseases.</p>
	 
	 <a id="adaptation-actions">
	<h3>Adaptation Actions</h3>
	
	<h4>Building Adaptive Capacity</h4>
	
	<p>Adaptive capacity is the ability to understand climate change, to evaluate its consequences for vulnerable communities, places, economies and ecosystems, to moderate potential damages and to take advantage of opportunities.</p>  
	
	<p>In order to deliver responsive adaptation actions, building adaptive capacity is required and involves undertaking activities that increase our ability to adapt to climate change.  These activities include:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>gathering the information required to understand the particular vulnerabilities to climate change a business, community or area might face;</li>
	<li>providing the information, procedures, tools and supporting structures required as a basis for the delivery of adaptation actions.</li>
	
	<h4>Implementing Adaptive Actions</h4>
	<p>
	Implementing adaptive actions refers to implementing actions that will help reduce climate risk and exploit opportunities.  In adapting to the challenges of climate change, a number of strategies have been identified that are robust to uncertainty, including those that are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Low regret</b>, being functional and providing benefits under a wide range of climate futures;</li>
	<li><b>Reversible</b>, in that costs are kept to a minimum in the case of assumptions regarding climate impact or adaptation response prove incorrect;</li>
	<li><b>Provide safety margins</b> which allow for climate change in the design or retrofitting of infrastructures;</li>
	<li><b>Soft</b>, thereby avoiding the need for expensive and typically irreversible engineering solutions and seek to institutionalise a long-term perspective in planning;</li>
	<li><b>Reduce the time horizons of investments</b>; and are</li>
	<li><b>Flexible</b> and <b>mindful of actions that are being taken by others</b> to either mitigate or adapt to climate change.</li>
	</ul>
	
	</div>
	</div>
	<div id="adaptation-policy">
	<a name="Adaptation Policy">
	<h2>Adaptation Policy</h2>
	<p>Until recently, climate change policy has focused on actions to mitigate against climate change consequences though reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and enhancing sinks.  However, it is now recognised that adaptation is required to offset the detrimental impacts and take advantage of the opportunities presented by climatic change.  As a result, policy at both <a href="#policy-ireland">National</a> and <a href="#policy-europe">European</a> levels has begun to put in place frameworks to allow for planned adaptation to climate change.  This section provides an overview of these policies.</p>
	<a id="policy-eu">
	<h3>Adaptation Policy in the EU</h3></a>
	<p>The European Commission published a White Paper <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0147:FIN:EN:PDF" target="blank">"Adaptation to climate change: Towards a European framework for action"</a> in April 2009.  The paper calls for a more strategic approach to climate change adaptation to ensure that 'timely and effective adaptation measures are taken, ensuring coherency across different sectors and levels of governance'.  The overall aim of the strategy is to increase the climate resilience of a number of sectors which include health and social policies; biodiversity, ecosystems and water; coastal and marine; and production systems and physical infrastructures.  Moreover, a key area involves the role of the EU in addressing impacts of climate change that transcend the barriers of individual countries, e.g. river and sea basins.  The framework is based around a two-phase approach and recognises that close cooperation among stakeholders (EU, national, regional and local levels) will be required.  
	</p>
	<p>The first phase of the EU approach aims to lay the foundation for a comprehensive EU adaptation strategy to be implemented in the second phase.  The first phase has focused on the preparation of an overall EU framework for climate adaptation.  This has involved a number of key tasks which include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The collection of relevant information;</li>
	<li>The identification of climate change impacts for the EU;</li>
	<li>The mainstreaming of adaptation measures into key EU policies;</li>
	<li>The strengthening of international cooperation in the field of adaptation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This first phase culminated in the publication of an EU Adaptation Strategy  in 2013.  The focus now shifts to the second phase and the implementation of this strategy.  This will involve the mainstreaming of adaptation into key EU level policies, which include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP);</li>
	<li>Structural and Cohesion Funds;</li>
	<li>and Research.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<a id="policy-ireland"><h3>Adaptation Policy in Ireland</h3></a>
	
	<p><img src="/img/NAF-framework.svg" align="right" hspace="5px"/>Prior to the publication of <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/ClimateChange/FileDownLoad,32076,en.pdf" target="blank">Ireland's National Climate Change Adaptation Framework</a>, mitigation actions formed the impetus for climate change policy in Ireland.   However, the importance of adaptation was recognised in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad,1861,en.pdf"target="blank">Ireland's second National Climate Change Strategy (2007)</a>, and the principle of integrating adaptation into decision-making at national and local levels was established.</p>

	<p>In 2013, the need for adaptation was highlighted through the publication of Ireland's <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/ClimateChange/FileDownLoad,32076,en.pdf" target="blacnk">'National Climate Change Adaptation Framework'</a>, which draws together the work already done by government and the wider public sector on adaptation, with the objectives of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>providing the policy context for a strategic national adaptation response to climate;</li>
	<li>promoting dialogue and understanding of adaptation issues;</li>
	<li>identifying and promoting adaptation solutions;</li>
	<li>and committing actions to support the adaptation process.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Similar to the European framework, Ireland's national framework is a two step approach of which The National Adaptation Framework represents a first phase of a longer term process which will strengthen over time as the knowledge base evolves and the policy base matures.</p> 
	
	<p>Work in Phase 1 is now well underway and is focused on identifying national vulnerability to climate change, based on potential impacts relative to current adaptive capacity.  Reliable information on the range of socio-economic vulnerabilities, the adaptation options available and their associated costs and benefits in an Irish context, are key elements to inform effective adaptation planning.  While this process is by no means complete, it is now thought the there is sufficient information available to allow the process of adaptation planning to begin in parralel with the tasks required of phase 2.</p>  
	
	<p>The second phase involves the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation plans.  These will form a part of the comprehensive response to climate change.</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>Sectoral plans are to be prepared by the relevant department or agencies, and adopted by the relevant minister, with draft plans to be published by mid-2014 and, following approval should be reviewed at least every 5 years.</li>  
	<li>The spatial planning process with full engagement of key stakeholders, will provide the means to implement and integrate adaptation at the local level.  As local authorities review their development plans, they will now be required to integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation into these plans.  Local authorities should assess the extent to which existing development plans adequately address adaptation and where appropriate, aim to have a review process of their development plan underway by mid-2014 if climate adaptation is not adequately addressed.  Local development planning will, in effect, become the delivery mechanism for local climate adaptation action.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p><h3>Overview of Actions</h3></p>
	<p>The following is taken directly from Ireland's National Climate Change Adaptation Framework and provides an overview of actions for the five key areas identified through the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework.</p>
	
	<h4>Research and Knowledge Base</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to prioritise the filling of gaps in climate research needs and ensure that accessible information will continue to be provided to support the adaptation decision-making process. Other research work on adaptation in specific sectors is often carried out or commissioned by other Government Departments/bodies such as the OPW, Teagasc, Coford, etc. This research work will also continue to be supported and promoted by other relevant Departments.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support the EPA in continuing to play a lead role in building the evidence base and tools to help organisations adapt to climate change.</li>
	<li>To promote a more consistent approach to the dissemination of adaptation research and best practice, the EPA will continue to lead in the development of a web-based tool (to be known as the Climate Platform (CIP)) to help stakeholders plan their own decisions on adapting to climate change. The Climate Platform will include details of all EPA funded research on adaptation and the associated findings. Other State bodies will also provide specifics of their adaptation research for publication on the Platform.</li>
	<li>Future work under the EPA’s Climate Change Research Programme will take account of the need for adaptation indicators to assist in monitoring and reviewing of plans as well as allowing for comparison across plans.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support Met &Eacute;ireann in its development of climate prediction systems and provision of climate services for Ireland. Met Éireann will integrate its efforts with European and international initiatives within the overall co-ordination of the World Meteorological Organisation.</li>
	<li>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support the development of enhanced national co-ordination of observation systems under the leadership of the EPA and Met Éireann who will, with the assistance of other responsible bodies and institutions, provide periodic updates on the state of Ireland’s climate system and provide analysis of data from this system.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Governance</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will lead and co-ordinate on international, EU and national climate adaptation policy, working as appropriate through the Cabinet Committee system. It will support and promote innovative policy-making on climate adaptation at all levels, and support strategic decision-making on how best to address the impacts of climate change.</li>
	<li>Individual Ministers will take responsibility for adaptation in their respective sector(s).</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community, and Local Government will support implementation of the Framework by local authorities.</li>
	<li>The City and County Managers’ Association (CCMA) will play an advisory role and facilitate the exchange of best practice in the implementation and development of climate adaptation policy at local level, fostering a shared approach to managing the impacts of climate change.</li>
	<li>In supporting local communities, local authorities must consider the issue of climate adaptation in the delivery of its services and infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Sectoral Plans</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Each relevant Government Department (or State Agency, where appropriate) will prepare adaptation plans for their sectors.</li>
	<li>Draft sectoral plans, based on sectoral risk assessments and following consultation with relevant stakeholders, to be published, by mid-2014 and adopted as quickly as possible thereafter.</li>
	<li>Sectoral adaptation plans should be revised and updated at least every 5 years. However, where sectoral mitigation plans are required under the proposed forthcoming primary legislation on climate change, both adaptation and mitigation plans should be prepared and reviewed in tandem to ensure full coherence of analysis and actions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Local Plans</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Local Authorities will take a proactive approach to climate change adaptation by integrating adaptation into the development of relevant policies, plans and programmes.</li>
	<li>As local authorities review their city and county development plans, they should integrate climate change adaptation (as well as mitigation) considerations into their statutory plans.</li>
	<li>Local authorities should aim to have the review process of their development plans underway by mid- 2014 (if necessary, through amendment and variation procedures) to include climate change adaptation if this is not already adequately addressed. As part of this process, local authorities will continue to collect evidence, raise awareness, and create the necessary relationships and actions needed to deliver purposeful adaptation measures.</li>
	<li>Once adopted, local plans will be reviewed thereafter in line with the cycle of development plan review under the planning and development legislative code.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will support and facilitate this approach through the preparation of guidelines for integrating climate adaptation into development plans as well as well as guidance on adaptation proofing of Strategic Environment Assessment</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Stakeholder Consultation</h4>
	<li>Government Departments and bodies will adopt an open, transparent, and inclusive approach to sectoral adaptation planning, with interested organisations and stakeholders being given early and adequate opportunity to input to the process of preparing adaptation plans.</li>
	<li>Public bodies will engage directly with others that are influenced by their policy decisions and embed adaptation as necessary into key areas of work such as investment in infrastructure, and the procurement of goods and services.</li>
	<li>Local authorities will continue to consult and encourage partnership with stakeholders when addressing adaptation matters at a local level, particularly through the open and participative process for making development plans, into which local adaptation planning is to be integrated.</li>
	<li>Each relevant Minister will foster a co-operative relationship with the private sector, and in particular the insurance sector, for the collection and dissemination of data on weather and catastrophe risk.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How to Adapt?</h2></a>
	<p>
	Adaptation is <b>an ongoing and iterative process</b> rather than a discrete project or event. Therefore, it is <b>important to integrate adaptation into existing planning and decision-making processes</b>.  There are a number of key elements to the adaptation process and these are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Gather available information and develop a robust knowledge base;</li>
	<li>Assessment of vulnerability;</li>
	<li>Development of strategic objectives;</li>
	<li>Identification and assessment of adaptation requirements and their associated options, together with an estimation of costs and benefits;</li>
	<li>Develop an adaptation action plan;</li>
	<li>A review mechanism</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	
	</p>
	<h3>1. Gather available knowledge and develop a robust knowledge base</h3>
	
	<p>The changing climate will present different challenges for individual sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations.  As a result, in order to get started in the adaptation process, a clear understanding of your expected climate change exposure and the sensitivity of your sector, area, ecosystem, population and therefore consequential potential impacts is a fundamental starting point.  To date, some sectors have started to identify the potential impacts of climate change on their area of business and this information will provide you with a very useful knowledge base.</p>

	<p>Changing climate will affect a wide range of actors at sectoral, local, regional and national levels.  As a result, the process of making adaptation plans should be open, transparent and inclusive and opportunity should be provided to all interested individuals and organisations to input to the process of preparing the plans.  Importantly, such stakeholder engagement will offset the possibility of maladaptation whereby an adaptation decision in one sector/area might have adverse consequences for another sector or local area.  Therefore, a key step in developing an adaptation plan involves identifying and engaging with those who are likely to be affected by the adaptation plan, or those whose support will be required to successfully implement any adaptation decision taken.  This will allow for flexible responses to climate-related risks.

	<h3>2. Assessment of vulnerability</h3>
	<p>
	
	<p>In the context of adaptation, vulnerability can be seen as a measure of the susceptibility of a sector, group, region or activity to unacceptable levels of climate risk.  Assessing vulnerability involves identifying who and what is exposed to climatic and non-climatic risk and consideration of the specific factors that make people or the environment sensitive to climate change.  Moreover, assessing vulnerability enhances our understanding of the systems we manage, and, through helping to build a baseline against which observed and projected climate impacts can be gauged, is also a critical component in the development of strategies or policies to limit the losses and exploit the benefits resulting from change </p> 
	
	<i>Current vulnerability</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>As well as creating novel future problems to address, climate change is expected to exacerbate the existing vulnerabilities of most sectors and regions.  As a result, understanding your current vulnerability is important and will help you to understand how future climate changes will impact you.  Identifying existing vulnerability will involve coming to a clear understanding of how climate currently affects you, both directly and indirectly.  In addition, an examination of current non-climatic pressures is also important as climate may indirectly alter how these pressures are manifest.  In this respect, detailing these non-climatic pressures will provide useful insight into the sensitivities you must be cognisant of, and the adaptive capacities you have at your disposal in preparing for climate change.</p>   
	</p>
	
	<p>In understanding your current vulnerability, key questions might include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How have <b>previous weather events</b> affected your organisation or community?</li> 
	<li>Were <b>critical thresholds exceeded</b> that resulted in losses or opportunities?</li>
	<li>How well did you cope?</li>
	<li>Were there any <b>indirect impacts</b> that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the key non-climatic pressures your organisation or community currently faces?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<i>Future vulnerability</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>Once you have gained an understanding of your current vulnerability to climate change, you can begin to examine how a changing climate might affect you in the future.  However, possible climate futures need to also be examined in the context of social and economic change.</p>  
	
	<p>There is uncertainty associated with projections of future climate.  However, the science indicates increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea levels and increases in extreme events are likely to be encountered in the near to medium term.  In order to overcome the uncertainties surrounding the precise nature of climate impact regime encountered in a given location or by a given sector, a wide range of future climate scenarios should be explored.  This exploration should provide you with a clear understanding of how the range of potential consequences of climate change might affect your sector or local area. This will allow you to investigate in more detail, the specific climate issues you may  encounter and how best to respond to them.</p>  
	
	<ul>
	<li>How is <b>climate expected to change and what are the key impacts?</b></li>
	<li>Are there <b>indirect impacts</b> that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the <b>priority risks</b>?</li>
	<li>How will the non-climatic pressures you face change and evolve in the future?</li>
	<li>Will these changes increase the sensitivity of your sector or community to climate change or enhance its capacity to adapt?</li>

	</p>
	<h3>3. Development of Strategic Objectives</h3>
	
	<p>
	Adaptation occurs by improving coping strategies or by reducing exposure to known threats. Based on the information collected in step 2, <b>strategic objectives</b> should be developed that will <b>address the short-term/current and long-term priority risk and opportunities</b>.  Initially, <b>a range of objectives should be identified</b>.  In light of the uncertainty surrounding projections of future climate and developmental trends, these objectives should to as great an extent as possible focus on enhancing the flexibility of the system in coping with future change.  
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>4. Identification and assessment of adaptation requirements</h3>
	<p>
	After prioritising current and possible future climatic risks and, on this basis, developing a set of strategic objectives, <b>an inventory of adaptation options should be identified</b>.  Through screening and appraisal, a subset of preferred adaptation options that would reduce vulnerability under the current climate should be identified that are socially, technically and economically feasible given the prevailing regulatory environment.  If the lifetime of the option is short term, a few years or less, testing against current climate variability might be appropriate.  However, if the lifetime of the option is long term, testing against future scenarios will be required.  Given the uncertainty associated with projections of future climate, long-term adaptation options should be open-ended and flexible, and testing should be undertaken against the full range of projected climatic changes.
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>
	Adaptation options include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Low-regret</b> options will deliver benefits whatever the extent of climate change, e.g. not building infrastructure in high-risk areas such as floodplains.</li>
	<li><b>Win-win</b> options will enhance your adaptive capacity while also helping to achieve other social, environmental or economic goals, e.g. improving the cooling capacity of buildings through increased shading and/or less energy intensive cooling strategies. </li>
	<li><b>Flexible or adaptive management</b> options will explicitly account for the opportunity to treat intervention as an experimental, learning experience, by which the performance of adaptive measures can be incrementally improved over time adaptation actions.</li>
	<li><b>To delay a decision</b> to implement an adaptation measure is also a viable option, provided the postponement is used to find out more about the problem.</li>
	<li><b>A decision to do nothing</b> may also represent a legitimate option in a situation where climate risks are outweighed by other factors.  This decision, however, should not be used as a default position and should only be reached after careful consideration of your climate risks and adaptation options.</li>
	<li><b>Monitoring</b> the scale and impact of change as it unfolds is likely to be an appropriate option in all circumstances, in order that a knowledge base of locally/sectorally specific impacts is developed over time, and to help steer adaptation decision making in the future.  This is a particularly important factor to bear in mind where the decision is to delay adaptation action or do nothing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>5. Develop an adaptation action plan</h3>
	<p>
	Having considered risks (Step 2) and selected preferred adaptation options, <b>an implementation plan needs to be developed that states what needs to be done, by whom and when, to convert adaptation options into actions</b>.  The implementation of adaptation options will be contingent on the chosen adaptations and being <b>strongly linked to existing policies and procedures</b>.
	</p>
	<p>In Ireland, mainstreaming of adaptation into existing policies and procedures is to be principally achieved through:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Spatial Planning - At a local level, adaptation is to be incorporated into development (City and County) and local area plans.  The changing climate will present different challenges to each local authority based on their vulnerability to climate risk and their capacity to adapt.  As a result, preparation for expected impacts and integrating appropriate responses into the development of policies, plans and programmes is required.  As a first step, existing development and local area plans are to be reviewed to include climate change adaptation (if necessary through amendment and variation procedures) if this is not already adequately addressed.  This review process is to be underway by mid-2014.  In effect, development plans will become the mechanism for the delivery of local adaptation action.</li>   
	<li>Sectoral Planning - At a sectoral level, adaptation is to be incorporated into sectoral plans developed by relevant Government Department or State Agency.  Draft sectoral plans are to be published by mid-2014 and will be based on sectoral risk assessments.</li>
	<li>SEA Procedures - In line with European Directives and national policy, the conduct of SEA in Ireland will involve greater emphasis on the role of climate adaptation.  As knowledge accrues with respect to the efficacy and indirect effects of adaptation initiatives, scoping and cumulative impacts assessment processes will incorporate analyses of how adaptation objectives will be met in assessing the credentials of a given plan, policy or programme.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>6. A review mechanism</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation is <b>an iterative process that needs to be closely monitored</b> with regular review to ensure that it remains effective.  Moreover, adaptation plans will need to be updated and refined over time as more information on impacts becomes available and experience of adaptation increase.  This step will ensure that the adaptation initiatives are working and will <b>determine whether changes or refinements are required in response to new conditions and information</b>.
