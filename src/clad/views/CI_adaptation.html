    <h2>Climate Adaptation</h2></a>
    <p>
      
    <b>Climate is changing and without taking appropriate actions to address the impacts and take advantage of opportunities presented by these changes, potentially disastrous consequences can be expected.</b> 
	 <div class="picture right"> 
	<img src="/img/mitigation-adaptation.jpg"/> <br/>Mitigation actions result in decreased levels of greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing the extent of future climate change.  However, due to greenhouse gases already emitted, climate change and its affects are inevitable.  Adaptation actions aim to reduce the impacts of climate change and also to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change</div>
	<div class="picture right"> 
	  <img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg"/> <br/>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the affects of a climate hazard.  Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</div>
    </p>
	<p>
	Mitigation refers to actions that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving climate change; it includes reducing activities that give rise to emissions of greenhouse gases and enhance sinks for greenhouse gases in the forests and biosphere.  However, greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so even if we were to stop emitting them tomorrow, the climatic effects of these emissions would stay with us for the foreseeable future. To further compound the inevitability of the climate impacts, a long and slow process of warming of the Earth's oceans has been underway for many decades, a process that will ensure temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise throughout the century. 
	<p>
	<b>As a result, regardless of our efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change, adaptation actions are now essential.</b>
	</p>
	
    <p>
    In their fourth Assessment Report, <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">the IPCC</a> (2007) defines adaptation as: "adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities".  Another useful definition of adapatation is "Adaptation refers to the adjustment or preperation of natural or human systems to a new or changing environment, with the aim of moderating harm or exploiting beneficial opportunities" <span class="reference">[4]</span> 
     </p>
    <p>
	
   
    <p>
	The <b>aim of adaptation is to reduce society's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change</b> by anticipating changes in climatic conditions and the effects of these changes. <b>Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes (IPCC 2007)</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	To date many adaptation actions have been both autonomous and reactive.  For example, many adaptive actions can be taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances due to experiences or perceptions of climate risk.  These autonomuous adjustments can be beneficial and can often take place without policy intervention.  However, autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal as there will be missed efficiency gains that would accrue from concerted actions.  Moreover, autonomous adaptation in one sector may have adverse effects on another sector, resulting in maladaptation.</p>
	  
	<p>
	<b>Maladaptation occurs when an adaptation action results in an increase rather than a decrease in overall vulnerability to climate change impacts</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>In addition, many adaptive actions have been responsive, for example, by taking place after an extreme weather event has occurred.  However, given the increased knowledge of climate change impacts, it is now necessary to develop adaptation actions through planning so that we are better placed to deal with future events.  Moreover by planning an anticipating climate change impacts, it is possible to reduce the effects and maximise the effectiveness of adaptation actions.
	</p>
	
	<p>Planned adaptation responses are determined by the vulnerability of the system to climate change impacts and its adaptive capacity.  Adaptation actions should aim to address climate change impacts and also increase adaptive capacity. As a result, in order to plan effectively for adaptation, a number of building blocks need to be in place to aid a comprehensive and coherent national adaptation response:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><b>A robust knowledge base</b> - a clear understanding of expected exposure to climate change and the sensitivity og sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations and consequential potential impacts</li>
	<li><b>An assessment of adaptive capacity</b></li>
	<li><b>A vulnerability assessment</b></li>
	<li><b>Identification of adaptation requirements and teh associated options , together with an estimation of costs and benefits</b></li>

      <h2>Why Adapt?</h2></a>
    <p>
      <center>
	<b>Irrespective of the level of mitigation we are able to enact, adaptation is necessary to avoid or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and to explore any potential benefits that might be exploited</a></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>

    Climate change will have both direct and indirect effects on all aspects of Ireland's economy, society, and environment.  Direct impacts will include increasing temperatures, more extreme weather conditions, an increased likelihood of river and coastal flooding, water shortages, changes in types and distributions of species and the possible extinction of vulnerable species.  Climate change will also impact upon other countries and in a globalising world, the consequences of climate change in distant places will affect Ireland.  For example, Irish companies have investments in many countries and Ireland is reliant upon foreign trade.</p>    
	
	<p>Human and natural systems will adapt to climate change autonomously to some degree.  However, <b>planned adaptation which involves decisions and measures within society to respond to the adverse impacts and opportunities presented by climate change is essential if unacceptable level risk are to be avoided.</b>.  Moreover, well planned, pro-active adaptation will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change and avoid incurring the worst of the considerable costs that climate change may pose.</p>  
	
	<p>Importantly although there are uncertainties about our knowledge of future climate, particularly local impacts of climate change, all the science indicates increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea levels and increasing occurences of extreme events.  As a result, a wait-and-see approach is not an option for climate change adaptation; adaptation decisions, particularly those with long-term implications, need to be made now on the basis of the best available, albeit to some extent incomplete information, drawing on approaches to formulating strategies that are both prudent and robust to uncertainty.  <b>Being prepared</b> for these changes is important and will help to <b>reduce uncertainty and costs</b>that climate change will pose.  We can act to limit the potential impacts of climate change by <b>identifying risks, evaluating options and starting the adaptation process early</b> enough to ensure that as many alternatives as possible remain available to us.
    </p>
	
    <p><b>Successful adaptation does not mean that the negative impacts of climate change will not occur, only that they will be less severe than had no adaptation taken place</b>.
    </p> 
    <p>
    The goals of adaptation might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Alleviating the current impacts</b> of climate change;</li>
      <li><b>Reducing sensitivity and exposure</b> to climate change;</li>
      <li><b>Increasing resilience</b> to climate and non-climatic stressors;</li>
	  <li><b>Identifying opportunities to exploit any benefits that migth accompany a changing climate</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div id="adaptation-actions">
  <a name="Adaptation Actions">
	<h2>Adaptation Actions</h2></a>
	<p>
	Adaptation actions aim to manage climate risk at an acceptable level and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. Adaptation incorporates both steps to <b>build adaptive capacity</b> and to <b> implement adaptive actions</b>.  
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Building adaptive capacity</b> involves activities that increase our ability to adapt to climate change.  These activities include gathering the information required to understand the particular vulnerabilities to climate change a business, community or area might face, providing the information, procedures, tools and supporting structures required as a basis for the delivery of adaptation actions.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Information required for climate change planning includes <b>reliable data on the expected impacts of climate change, existing adaptive capacity, vulnerabilities, costs and benefits and adaptation options.</b>. 
	</li>
	<li>Putting in place the procedures, tools and supporting structures involves awareness raising, obtaining senior management and community agreement and integrating climate risk and adaptation into planning and decision-making processes.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Implementing adaptive actions</b> refers to implementing actions that will help reduce climate risk and exploit opportunities.  In adapting to the challenges of climate change, <b>a number of strategies have been identified that are robust to uncertainty</b> and these include: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Strategies that are <b>low regret</b> being functional and providing benefits under a wide range of climate futures;</li>
	<li>Strategies that are <b>reversible</b> in that costs are kept to a minimum in the case of being wrong;</li>
	<li>Strategies that <b>provide safety margins</b> which allow for climate change in the design or retrofitting of infrastructures;</li>
	<li>Strategies that are <b>soft</b> by avoiding the need for expensive engineering and institutionalise a long-term perspective in planning;</li>
	<li>Strategies that <b>reduce the time horizons of investments</b>; and</li>
	<li>Strategies that are <b>flexible</b> and <b>mindful of actions that are being taken by others</b> to either mitigate or adapt to climate change.</li>

	<h2>How to Adapt?</h2></a>
	<p>
	Adaptation is <b>an ongoing and iterative process</b> rather than a discrete project or event. Therefore, it is <b>important to integrate adaptation into existing planning and decision-making processes</b>.  There are a number of key elements to the adaptation process and these are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Gather available information and develop a robust knowledge base;</li>
	<li>Assessment of vulnerability;</li>
	<li>Development of strategic objectives;</li>
	<li>Identification and assessment of adaptation requirements and the associated options, together with an estimation of costs and benefits;</li>
	<li>Develop an adaptation action plan;</li>
	<li>A review mechanism</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	
	</p>
	<h3>1. Gather available knowledge and develop a robust knowledge base</h3>
	
	<p>The changing climate will present different challenges for individual sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations.  As a result, in order to get started in the adaptation process, a clear understanding of your expected climate change exposure and the sensitivity of your sector, area, ecosystem and population and consequential potential impacts is a fundamental starting point.  To date, some sectors have started to identify the potential impacts of climate change on their area of business and this information will provide you with a very useful knowledge base.</p>

	<p>Changing climate will affect a wide range of actors at sectoral, local, regional and national levels.  As a result, the process of making adaptation plans should be open, transparent and inclusive and opportunity should be provided to all interested individuals and organisations to input to the process of preparing the plans.  Importantly, such stakeholder engagement will offset the possibility of maladaptation whereby an autonomous adaptation decision in one sector/area might have adverse consequences for another sector or local area.  Therefore, a key step in developing an adaptation plan involves identifying and engaging with those who are likely to be affected by or those whose support will be required to successfully implement any adaptation decision taken.  This will allow for flexible responses to climate-related risks.

	</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>2. Assessment of vulnerability</h3>
	<p>
	
	<p>In the context of adaptation, vulnerability can be seen as a measure of the susceptibility of a sector, group, region or activity to unacceptable levels of climate risk.  Assessing vulnerability involves dentifying who and what is exposed to climatic and non-climatic risk and consideration of the specific factors that make people or the environment sensitive to climate change.  Moreover, assessing vulnerability enhances our understanding of the systems we manage, and through helping to build a baseline against which observed and projected climate impacts can be gauged is a critical component in teh development of strategies or policies to limit the losses and exploit the benefits resulting form change </p> 
	
	<i>Current vulnerability</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>As well as creating novel future problems to address, climate change is expected to exacerbate the existing vulnerabilities of most sectors and regions.  As a result, understanding your current vulnerability is important and will help you to understand how future climate changes will impact you.  Identifying existing vulnerability will involve coming to a clear understanding of how climate currently affects you, both directly and indirectly.  In addition, an examination of current non-climatic pressures is also important as climate may indirectly alter how these pressures are manifest in the futureimpacts on these pressures.  In this respect, detailing these non-climatic pressures will provide useful insight into the sensitivities you must be cognisant of and adaptive capacities you have at your disposal in preparing for climate change.</p>   
	</p>
	
	<p>In understanding your current vulnerability, key questions might include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How have <b>previous weather events</b> affected your organisation or community?</li> 
	<li>Were <b>critical thresholds exceeded</b> that resulted in losses or opportunities?</li>
	<li>How well did you cope?</li>
	<li>Were there any <b>indirect impacts</b> that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the key non-climatic pressures your organisation or community currently faces?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<i>Future vulnerability</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>Once you have gained an understanding of your current vulnerability to climate change, you can begin to examine how a changing climate might affect you in the future.  However, possible climate futures need to also be examined in the context of social and economic change.</p>  
	
	<p>There is uncertainty associated with projections of future climate.  However, the science indicates increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea levels and increases in extreme events are likely to be encountered in the near to medium term.  In order to overcome the uncertainties surrounding the precise nature of climate impact regime encountered in a given location or by a given sector, a wide range of future climate scenarios should be explored.  This exploration should provide you with a clear understanding of how the range of potential consequence of climate change might affect your sector or local area. This will allow you to investigate in more detail, the specific climate issues you may  encounter and how best to respond to them.</p>  
	
	<ul>
	<li>How is <b>climate expected to change and what are the key impacts?</b></li>
	<li>Are there <b>indirect impacts</b> that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the <b>priority risks</b>?</li>
	<li>How will the non-climatic pressures you face change and evolve in the future?</li>
	<li>Will these changes increase the sensitivity of your sector or community to climate change or enhance its capacity to adapt?</li>
	</ul>

	</p>
	<h3>3. Development of Strategic Objectives</h3>
	
	<p>
	Adaptation occurs by improving coping strategies or by reducing exposure to known threats. Based on the information collected in step 2, <b>strategic objectives</b> should be developed that will <b>address the short-term/current and long-term priority risk and opportunities</b>.  Initially, <b>a range of objectives should be identified</b>.  In light of the uncertainty surrounding projections of future climate and developmental trends, these objectives should toas great an extent as possible focus on enhancing the flexibility of the system in coping with future change.  
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>4. Identification and assessment of adaptation requirements</h3>
	<p>
	After prioritising current and possible future climatic risks and, on this basis, developing a set of strategic objectives, <b>an inventory of adaptation options should be identified</b>.  Through screening and appraisal, a subset of preferred adaptation options that would reduce vulnerability under the current climate should be identified that are socially, technically and economically feasible given the prevailing regulatory environment.  If the lifetime of the option is short term, a few years or less, testing against current climate variability might be appropriate.  However, if the lifetime of the option is long term, testing against future scenarios will be required.  Given the uncertainty associated with projections of future climate, long-term adaptation options should be open-ended and flexible, and testing should be undertaken against the full range of projected climatic changes.
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>
	Adaptation options include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Low-regrets</b> options will deliver benefits whatever the extent of climate change, e.g. not building infrastructure in high-risk areas such as floodplains.</li>
	<li><b>Win-win</b> options will enhance your adaptive capacity while also helping to achieve other social, environmental or economic goals, e.g. improving the cooling capacity of buildings through increased shading and/or less energy intensive cooling strategies. </li>
	<li><b>Flexible or adaptive management</b> options involves incremental adaptation actions.</li>
	<li><b>To delay a decision</b> to implement an adaptation measure is also a viable option when the time is used to find out more about the problem.</li>
	<li><b>A decision to do nothing</b> may also represent a legitimate option in a situation where climate risks are outweighed by other factors.  This decision, however, should not be used as a default position and should only be reached after careful consideration of your climate risks and adaptation options.</li>
	<li><b>Monitoring</b> the scale and impact of change as it unfolds is likely to be an appropriate option in all circumstances, in order that a knowledge base of locally/sectorally specific impacts is developed over time to help steer adaptation decision making.  This is a particularly important factor to bear in mind where the decision is to delay adaptation action or do nothing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>5. Develop an adaptation action plan</h3>
	<p>
	Having considered risks (Step 2) and selected preferred adaptation options, <b>an implementation plan needs to be developed that states what needs to be done, by whom and when, to convert adaptation options into actions</b>.  The implementation of adaptation options will be contingent on the chosen adaptations and being <b>strongly linked to existing policies and procedures</b>.
	</p>
	<p>In Ireland, mainstreaming of adaptation into existing policies and procedures is to be principally achieved through:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Spatial Planning - At a local level, adaptation is to be incorporated into development (City and County) and local area plans.  The changing climate will present different challenges to each local authority based on their vulnerability to climate risk and their capacity to adapt.  As a result, preparation for expected impacts and integrating appropriate responses into the the development of policies, plans and programmes is required.  As a first step, existing development and local area plans are to be reviewed to include climate change adaptation (if necessary through amendment and variation procedures) if this is not already adequately addressed.  This review process is to be underway by mid-2014.  In effect, development plans will become the mechanism for the delivery of local adaptation action.</li>   
	<li>Sectoral Planning - At a sectoral level, adaptation is to be incorporated into sectoral plans developed by relevant Government Department or State Agency.  Draft sectoral plans are to be published by mid-2014 and will be based on sectoral risk assessments.</li>
	<li>SEA Procedures - In line with European Directives and national policy, the conduct of SEA in Ireland will involve greater emphasis on the role of climate adaptation.  As knowldge accrues with respect to the efficacy and indirect effects of adaptation initiatives, scoping and cumulative impacts assessment processes will incorporate analyses of how adaptation objectives will be met in assessing the credentials of a given plan, policy or programme.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>6. A review mechanism</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation is <b>an iterative process that needs to be closely monitored</b> with regular review to ensure that it remains effective.  moreover, adaptation plans will need to be updated and refined over time as more information on impacts becomes available and experience of adaptation increase.  This step will ensure that the adaptation initiatives are working and will <b>determine whether changes or refinements are required in response to new conditions and information</b>.
