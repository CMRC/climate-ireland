	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Climate is changing and the effects of these changes are already being felt and are expected to increase in the future.  For example, extreme events such as the European heat wave of summer 2003 which is estimated to have resulted in up to 70,000 deaths from heat induced illnesses are expected to occur more frequently <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.  Without taking appropriate actions to address the impacts of climate change and take advantage of opportunities presented by these changes, potentially disastrous consequences can be expected.</p>   
	
	<p><a href="#mitigation-and-adaptation">Mitigation and adaptation</a> describe the various ways and techniques to tackle climate change.  Mitigation refers to ours efforts to tackle the causes of climate change while adaptation is about adjusting the way we do things to ensure that we are prepared for climate change.  Continuing mitigation efforts will reduce the need for adaptation. However, due to our long history of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to the now inevitable consequences of climate change is required.</p>

	<h4>Mitigation</h4>
	<p>
	Climate change mitigation refers to actions that have been proposed to limit the magnitude and/or rate of long-term climate change.  Mitigation generally involves actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving climate change but may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of carbon sinks, e.g. through afforestation <span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.  However, greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so even if we were to stop emitting them tomorrow, the climatic effects of these emissions would stay with us for the foreseeable future. To further compound the inevitability of climate change impacts, a long and slow process of warming of the Earth's oceans has been underway for many decades, a process that will ensure temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise throughout the century.  As a result, regardless of our efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation actions are now essential in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Adaptation</h4>
    <p>
    Adaptation is required to protect people, buildings, infrastructure, businesses and ecosystem from the threats that climate change presents. Adaptation consists of actions responding to current and future climate change impacts and vulnerabilities (as well as to the climate variability that occurs in the absence of climate change) within the context of ongoing and expected societal change.  Moreover, it means not only protecting against the negative impacts of climate change but also building resilience and taking advantage of any opportunities that it might bring <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>. Therefore, the aim of adaptation is to reduce society's vulnerability to current climate variability and also to the impacts of climate change by anticipating changes in climatic conditions and the effects of these changes.  Vulnerability is defined as "the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes" <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  
	</p>
	<p>
	As the impacts of climate change vary spatially, adaptation requires locally specific, place-based responses, which address not only climate impacts but also integrate coherently with the local fabric of social, economic and ecological systems.  As a result, adaptation policy is typically developed at the national level but local differences in physical environment, land use and population make the task of implementing adaptation principally the concern of regional and local scale administrators, businesses and the general public <span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</p>  
	
	<a id="adaptation-responses">
	<div id="adaptation-responses">
	<h3>Adaptation Responses</h3>
	
	<p>Adaptation responses can be characterised under three broad categories:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><strong><font color="grey">'Grey'</font></strong> actions: technological and engineering solutions.  Examples include building or strengthening coastal defences;</li>
	<li><strong><font color="green">'Green'</font></strong> actions: ecosystem based approaches that use the multiple services of nature.</li>
	<li><strong><font color="blue">'Soft'</font></strong> actions: managerial, legal and policy approaches that alter human behaviour and style of governance.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In general, 'Green' and 'Soft' actions aim to decrease the sensitivity of a system to climate impacts and increase the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems to build resilience to climate impacts.  Moreover, in contrast to 'Grey' actions, 'Green' and 'Soft' actions are generally less resource intensive and provide multiple benefits where as 'Grey Solutions', typically require high levels of funding, more research, and more experience and training to be implemented.</p>

	<p>As the exact nature of future climate remains uncertain, adaptive responses can be further characterised according to the extent to which they are justifiable under different scenarios of climate change.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>'Low regret' adaptation options are functional and providing benefits under a wide range of climate futures and As a result, 'Low regret' options are of particular interest to policymakers;</li>
	<li>High-regret' adaptation options are particularly sensitive to choice of climate change scenario and would only make sense under a few climate change scenarios.</li>  
	
	<p>Adaptation responses can also be characterised according to the decision making process that lead to their implementation:</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>Autonomous adaptation is a spontaneous response in natural or human systems to a variety of factors including climatic stimuli, socio-economic developments and market forces.  In human systems, autonomous adaptation is generally taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances to changing conditions.  To date many adaptation actions have been both autonomous and reactive<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  These autonomous adjustments can be beneficial and can often take place without policy intervention.  However, autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal as there will be missed efficiency gains that would be gained from concerted actions.  Moreover, autonomous adaptation in one sector may have adverse effects on another sector, resulting in maladaptation, which occurs when an adaptation action results in an increase rather than a decrease in overall vulnerability to climate change impacts.</li>  
	<li>Planned adaptation aims to take measures to counter current or expected climatic impacts within the context of ongoing an expected societal change.  It is a deliberate decision taken due to an awareness that conditions have changed (reactive adaptation) or are about to change (anticipatory adaptation) and that action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  By anticipating and planning for climate change impacts, it is possible to reduce the costs and maximise the effectiveness of adaptation actions.  The type and scale of planned adaptation responses are determined both by the vulnerability of a given system to climate change impacts, and its inherent capability to adapt, or 'adaptive capacity'<span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.</li>
	</ul>    
	
	<p>Due to our increased knowledge of expected climate change impacts, it is now necessary to develop planned adaptation responses. In reality, adaptation will involve a mix of adaptation responses or 'combined adaptation actions' that will include grey, green and soft adaptation actions.</p>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
    
	<p>Irrespective of the level of mitigation we are able to enact,  climate change will have both direct and indirect effects on all aspects of Ireland's economy, society, and environment.  Adaptation is necessary to avoid or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and to explore any potential benefits that might be exploited.  As a result, regardless of uncertainties associated with future climate, a 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option.  Moreover, it has now been recognised that adaptation is an immediate need and there is now a clear policy mandate for adaptation to be incorporated into spatial planning practises in Ireland.</p>

	  <img src="/img/Ireland-snow.jpg"/> <figcaption>Ireland in the snow</figcaption></figure>
    
	
	<h3>A 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option</h3>
	
	<p>It is now clear that climate is changing and that these changes will continue and intensify in the future.  Although there are uncertainties about our knowledge of future climate, and the specific local impacts of climate change, a wait-and-see approach is not an option given the severity of the risks posed by climate change.
	</p>	
	<p>Human and natural systems will adapt to climate change autonomously to some degree.  However, planned adaptation which involves decisions and measures within society to respond to the adverse impacts and opportunities presented by climate change is essential if an unacceptable level of risk is to be avoided. Adaptation decisions, particularly those with long-term implications, need to be made now on the basis of the best available, albeit to some extent incomplete information.  This will involve drawing on approaches to strategy formulation that are both prudent and robust to uncertainty.  Being prepared for these changes is important and will help to reduce uncertainty, and the costs that climate change will pose.  We can act to limit the potential impacts of climate change by identifying risks, evaluating options and starting the adaptation process early enough to ensure that as many alternatives as possible remain available to us.  Moreover, well-planned, pro-active adaptation will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change and avoid incurring the worst of the considerable costs that climate change may impose in the absence of appropriate action.</p>
	
	<h3>Legislative requirement</h3>
	<p>Through the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, the Irish Government has recognised that climate adaptation is required to offset the worst consequences of climate change and take advantage of any opportunities that a changing climate might bring.  Moreover, the Irish Government recognises the importance of a strategic approach to climate change, and the critical importance of planning and development measures in delivering it.</p> 
	
	<p>The National Climate Change Adaptation Framework requires that adaptation plans are developed for the key sectors of the Irish economy and that local authorities take a proactive approach to climate change, integrating climate adaptation in the development of relevant policies, plans and programmes, and where necessary, retrospectively assessing plans recently enacted for the fitness of their handling of climate adaptation.</p>

	<h3>Successful Adaptation</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently, a large evidence base on what constitutes good/successful adaptation is lacking.  Nevertheless, to avoid mal-adaptation, adaptation efforts should at minimum endeavour to avoid those pitfalls of adaptation which have already been identified, including:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Measures that increase greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
	<li>Measures that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable groups in society;</li>
	<li>Measures that come with high opportunity costs (social, economic and environmental) in comparison with alternatives;</li>
	<li>Measures that reduce the incentive for actors to adapt, e.g. by increasing the reliance of actors on others actions;</li>
	<li>Measures that create a path dependency, i.e. that adopt trajectories which are difficult to change in the future due to high costs involved in such change.</li>
	</ul>
	
   <p>Moreover, successful adaptation does not mean that the negative impacts of climate change will not occur, only that they will be less severe than had no adaptation taken place.  On this basis, 
    the goals of adaptation might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alleviating the current impacts of climate change;</li>
      <li>Reducing sensitivity and exposure to future climate change;</li>
      <li>Increasing the resilience to climate and non-climatic stressors;</li>
	  <li>Identifying opportunities to exploit any benefits that might accompany a changing climate.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Approaches to Adaptation</h2></a>
	
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	
	 <a id="adaptation-approaches">
	<h3>Approaches to Adaptation<h3>
	 
	<h4>'Top-down' and 'Bottom-up' Approaches</h4>
	<p>Until recently, approaches to adaptation have been based on a standard impact-orientated, command and control (or 'top-down') approach.  This approach begins with simulated climate scenarios, generally downscaled to a regional basis, that are then applied to a specific target or unit, e.g. local area or watershed, through impact modelling.  Impacts on that unit are then estimated and on this basis, adaptation measures are then identified and evaluated.  While these studies have made significant contributions to the theoretical understanding of climate change, there are a number of criticisms to this approach and these include:</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>The scenarios employed are generally simplified versions of the locality under consideration</li>
	<li>The approach focuses on future climate.  As a result, it tries to address how uncertain impacts can be reduced by the process of adaptation unknown future socio-economic circumstances.</li>
	<li>The top-down approach often lacks sound damage estimates, which also fail to account for welfare effects or consideration of adaptive capacity.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In contrast to the 'top-down' approach, the 'bottom-up' approach to climate change is applied at the local scale, utilising a participatory approach.  The bottom-up approach first employs assessments of vulnerability to current climate variability and extremes, including an assessment of current adaptation strategies, policies and measures based on actual experience at different scales.  On this basis, the dimensions of new risks can the be assessed in the context of current knowledge and experience and can include information on broader changes (including demographic and socio-economic processes) as well as direct and indirect climate-related risks such as changing pests and diseases.</p>

	<h2>Adaptation & Uncertainty</h2></a>
	
	<div id="key-info">
	<strong>Key Information</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Uncertainty relates to quality of our knowledge of risk as defined by the probability of occurrence of a hazard and the magnitude of consequence;</li>
	<li>All decisions are designed to bring some future benefit to something or someone and uncertainty is evident in almost all decision making contexts;</li>
	<li>Rather than looking for optimal solutions, planning for climate change requires robust and flexible approaches which can incorporate new learning and experience</li>
	<li>Dynamic Adaptive management seeks to develop robust plans that are continuously assessed and adapted to changing future conditions, the availability of new information and learning.</li>
	</li>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/risk.JPG"/> <figcaption>Risk is the product of the probability of hazard and the magnitude of consequence.  Risks that have a high probability of occurrence with potentially high consequences are deemed high risk while those with a low probability of occurrence and potentially low consequences are deemed low risk. </figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Uncertainty describes the quality of our knowledge of risk.  Risk is commonly defined as the product of the probability or likelihood of occurrence of a hazard and the magnitude of consequence.  As a result, uncertainty may relate to either the probability or consequence components of risk <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<p>All decisions made are intended to bring some future benefit to something or someone and without uncertainty, these decisions would be straightforward.  However, in reality, making decisions is far more complex and generally involves judgements regarding uncertainty.  In order to overcome uncertainties and make well informed decisions, it is important to: (1) identify the sources of uncertainty, (2) understand how these uncertainties contribute to the decision uncertainty, and (3) manage the uncertainty in the decision making process. <span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<p>Making adaptation decisions is complex and requires knowledge of future and uncertain climatic changes.  In addition, because adaptation problems do not occur in isolation, difficulties in projecting non-climatic factors such as social, demographic, political and economic change is also problematic.  Moreover, in adaptation planning, the end point is not only determined by what is known or anticipated at present but also by future learning, experience and responses<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</p>   
	
	<p>However, adaptation decision-making does not require precise foresight of future change and uncertainties do not prevent anticipatory adaptation.  A number of approaches are available to enable decision makers to manage uncertainty and they can be employed at a variety spatial scales, from individual decisions to sector-based and national adaptation planning.  In contrast to approaches which seek to develop an optimal plan based on a narrowly defined set of circumstances, planning for climate change requires plans that are both robust and flexible<span class="reference"><a href="3">[3]</a></span>.</p>   
	
	<ul class="small-indent">
	<li>Robust decision making uses multiple views of the future to support a thorough evaluation of the full range of potential vulnerabilities and opportunities.  On this basis, a plan is developed that is robust across a broad range of possible futures but may not necessarily perform optimally in any single future <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  For example, instead of planning for a dam that will have a 100 year lifespan and will fulfil its purpose under a set of prescribed set of conditions, a robust strategy identifies the full range of possible futures and then seeks strategies that will perform well over a wide range of alternative futures.</li>  
	
	<li>Flexible approaches to adaptation comprise those where decisions are made overtime to continuously adapt while maintaining flexibility about future options.  Moreover, flexible approaches encourage robust planning practises that avoid lock-in, i.e. when policy is placed on an unchanging pathway as the result of a once off adaptation decision that cannot be revisited<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h3>Adaptive Management</h3>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/adapt-mgt.jpg"/> <figcaption>Adaptive management allow for adjustment of plans based on new learning and experience and involves a process of continuing phases of assessment, design, implementation, monitoring and adjustment.</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Adaptive Management is a term which describes the ability to change plans based on new experience or information<span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.  Adaptive management calls for managers to take an ecosystem-level view of the resource that they manage and provides a structured approach for developing dynamic and robust adaptation plans.  It sets out a process of continuing and iterative phases of assessment, design, implementation and adjustment.  The process is often described as 'learning as we go' <span class="reference"><a href="#4">[4]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<p>Adaptive management occurs in two phases <span class="reference"><A href="#3">[3]</a></span>:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>The design phase, in which a dynamic adaptive plan, monitoring programme and pre- and post-implementation actions are designed;</li>
	<li>The implementation and monitoring phase.</li>  
	</ol>
	
	<p>However, the process is not linear as monitoring is continuous and may lead to different actions at various points in time<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<p>In developing an adaptive management plan, decision makers follow a number of steps <span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>:</p> 
	
	<ul>
	<li>The  existing condition of the area/resource under consideration is first assessed and objectives of the plan are specified;</li>
	<li>The means by which the objectives are to be achieved are then developed and a basic plan is assembled;</li>  
	<li>Once assembled, the basic plan is assessed in terms of meeting its objectives across the range of plausible futures.  The plan is then made more robust (performs well across the range of plausible futures) through four types of actions: shaping actions (actions to reduce failure or enhance success), mitigating actions (actions to reduce the likely adverse effects of a plan), hedging actions (actions to taken to spread or reduce the uncertain adverse affects of the plan) and seizing actions (actions to seize any likely opportunities);</li>
	<li>Mechanisms to monitor the plan over time are then identified.  Signposts specify information that should be tracked in order to determine if the plan is meeting its objectives.  Critical values of signposts (triggers) beyond which additional actions should be taken are identified.  This is called contingency planning.</li>  
	
	<p>The adaptive management plan is then implemented and monitored over time.  The plan is evaluated based on the status of the resource under consideration, indicated by signposts, and adjusted to reflect both lessons learned in the management process and also the development of new information.  Inherent in this design is a need for continuous data gathering , assessment and a commitment to following the process.</p>
	
	<h3>Adaptation Pathways and Adaptation Tipping Points</h3>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/pathways.jpg"/> <figcaption>An adaptation pathways 'route map' details the range of options available to a decision maker once an adaptation measure fails to meet its objective, this point in time in termed an 'adaptation tipping point'.  Once an ATP is identified, a range of options are then identified to form an adaptation tree.</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>In developing an adaptation plan, there is a need to consider timing of implementation of adaptation actions/measures and to and take a more flexible approach where decisions are taken overtime while at the same time maintaining flexibility about future options<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.</p>  
	
	<p>The adaptation pathways approach (also referred to at times as the 'route map' approach or 'decision pathways') is a new planning approach that has been developed to address uncertainty and build robustness not only into the measures taken but into the strategy itself.  It encourages decision makers to examine 'what if' outcomes and and take a more flexible approach where decisions are continuously made over time while maintaining flexibility about future options. Moreover, this approach aims to ensure that whatever measures are taken in the short to medium term are set within a framework that will not be maladaptive should climate change progress in a way that is not yet anticipated<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span> .</p>
	
	<p>In developing an Adaptation Pathways approach, policy objectives are taken as the starting point and the underlying question is: "How much climate change can the current strategy to meet our objectives cope with?".  Central to adaptation pathways are Adaptation Tipping Points (ATPs), which are the conditions under which the action no longer meets its objectives due to the magnitude of climate change, e.g. sea level rise.  This gives information on whether and when a current/future strategy may fail and other strategies are needed<span class="reference"><a href="#5">[5]</a></span>.  Following an ATP, the adaptation pathways approach presents a sequence of possible actions forming an adaptation tree<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.  On this basis, decision makers assess the current strategy against a range of plausible futures and ATPs are identified.  A range of adaptation options are then identified and adaptation trees formed.</p>
	
	<p>On this basis, decision makers design dynamic adaptive plans that contain a strategic vision of the future, commit to short and medium term actions, and establish a plan to guide future actions, meet changing circumstances and ensure resilience in the long term.  With the adaptation map, decision makers can identify opportunities, low regret measures, lock-ins and the timing of actions in order to support decision making in a changing environment<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.

	<h3>Dynamic Adaptive policy Pathways</h3>
	
	<p>Both the adaptation management and adaptation pathways approaches aim at supporting decision-making in the long term and in the face of uncertainty and emphasise the need for adaptability of plans.  More specifically, both approaches offer support in choosing near term actions while keeping open the possibility to modify extend or otherwise alter the plan in response to how the future unfolds <span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.  The combination of Adaptive Management and Adaptation Pathways is termed 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'<span class="reference"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>.  This approach includes transient scenarios representing a variety of uncertainties and their development overtime, different types of actions to hand vulnerabilities and opportunities, the sequencing of adaptation actions, and a monitoring system with related contingency actions to keep the plan on track to a preferred pathway<span class="reference"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>.</p> 
	
	<ol>
	<li>The first step involves describing the system, objectives constraints in the current and possible future situations.  In addition, a description of the uncertainties involved in the decision making process should be identified and are not restricted to uncertainties about the future but also about data or models that are being used;</li>  
	<li>The second step involves the development of future scenarios based on the uncertainties identified in the first step.  A comparison of the current situation and possible future situations can they be made and any vulnerabilities or opportunities that may arise are identified.  This determines if and when actions are needed;</li>  
	<li>To assemble a rich set of actions, these can be classified as shaping actions (actions to reduce failure or enhance success), mitigating actions (actions to reduce the likely adverse effects of a plan), hedging actions (actions to taken to spread or reduce the uncertain adverse affects of the plan) and seizing actions (actions to seize any likely opportunities).  These actions are then used to assemble adaptation pathways and the performance of each adaptation pathway is assessed in the light of the defined objectives to determine its adaptation tipping point.</li>  
	<li>Once a set of actions seem adequate, potential pathways can be constructed and one or more pathways can then be selected as input for a dynamic robust adaptation plan.  The aim of the plan is to keep the preferred pathway open as long as possible.  For this purpose, contingency actions are specified and a trigger for each contingency is specified and monitored </a></span>.</li>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Adaptation to climate change and the successful implementation of adaptation policy is a task which involves all levels of government (from local and regional through to national and European levels).  A key characteristic of successful adaptation policy is multi-level governance which relates to the vertical integration of all levels of governance.  While local and regional levels focus on the implementation of adaptation responses, national and international levels provide a more strategic role, framing and supporting adaptation policy<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>As the impacts of climate challenge differ spatially and according to local scale vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity, the implementation of adaptation is best undertaken at the local level.  Moreover, local stakeholders know the specific conditions of their area and are best placed to develop flexible solutions using this knowledge;</li>  
	<li>When adaptation issues cross local/municipal boundaries, regional governments play an important role as addressing these issues can be difficult for smaller/local jurisdictions to adequately address.  Hence a key role for regional governments is the coordination of spatial planning across municipal boarders;</li>
	<li>National Governments provide the link between local and regional actions and EU priorities.  Moreover, National governments play a key role in the mainstreaming of adaptation into national policies and in providing stakeholders at all levels with guidance on how to plan for climate change adaptation, assessments and funding.  Most importantly, national governments can provide national strategic frameworks that embed local and regional actions into the national context, linking local, regional and sectoral actions into the national context.</li>

	<h3>Adaptation Policy in the EU</h3></a>
	<p>In order to develop a more strategic approach to climate adaptation in the EU, the European Commission published the EU Adaptation Strategy in 2013.  This strategy sets out a framework and mechanisms for enhancing the EU's preparedness for current and future climate change impacts. The role of the EU is especially useful when climate change impacts transcend borders of individual member states, e.g. river basins, and when impacts very considerably across regions.  The role of the EU can also be useful in ensuring that regions which are most affected by climate change are capable of taking the necessary measures to adapt to climate change.  The strategy is focused around three key objectives:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Promoting action by member states</strong>:  The commission will encourage all member states to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies.  Currently, 15 member States, including Ireland, adopted national adaptation strategies;</li>
	<li><strong>Climate Proofing action at EU level</strong> by further promoting adaptation in key vulnerable sectors such s agriculture, fisheries and cohesion policy, ensuring that Europe's infrastructure is made more resilient, and promoting the use of insurance against natural and manmade disasters.</li>
	<li><strong>Better informed decision making</strong>: by addressing gaps in knowledge about adaptation and further the development of the <a href="http://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-Adapt)</a>.</li>

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/NAF_Framework.jpg"><figcaption>Ireland's NCCAF is a two step approach in which the NCCAF represents the first phase of a longer term process which will evolve overtime as new information becomes available.</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Currently, Ireland is one of the 15 EU member states to develop a national strategy for adaptation to climate change.  Prior to this publication, mitigation actions formed the focus of climate change policy in Ireland.   However, the importance of adaptation was recognised in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad,1861,en.pdf"target="blank">Ireland's second National Climate Change Strategy (2007)</a>, and the principle of integrating adaptation into decision-making at national and local levels was established.</p>

	<p>In 2013, the need for adaptation was highlighted through the publication of Ireland's <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/ClimateChange/FileDownLoad,32076,en.pdf" target="blank">National Climate Change Adaptation Framework (NCCAF)</a>.  The NCCAF draws together the work already done by government and the wider public sector on adaptation, with the objectives of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Providing the policy context for a strategic national adaptation response to climate;</li>
	<li>Promoting dialogue and understanding of adaptation issues;</li>
	<li>Identifying and promoting adaptation solutions;</li>
	<li>And committing actions to support the adaptation process.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Ireland's NCCAF is a two step approach of which the NCCAF represents a first phase of a longer term process which will strengthen over time as the knowledge base evolves and the policy base matures.</p> 
	
	<p>Work in Phase 1 is now well underway and is focused on identifying national vulnerability to climate change, based on potential impacts relative to current adaptive capacity.  Reliable information on the range of socio-economic vulnerabilities, the adaptation options available and their associated costs and benefits in an Irish context are key elements to inform effective adaptation planning.  While this process is by no means complete, it is now thought the there is sufficient information available to allow the process of adaptation planning to begin in parallel with the tasks required of phase 2.</p>  
	
	<p>The second phase involves the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation plans.  These will form a part of the comprehensive response to climate change.</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>Sectoral plans are to be prepared by the relevant department or agencies, and adopted by the relevant minister, with draft plans to be published by mid-2014 and, following approval should be reviewed at least every 5 years;</li>  
	<li>The spatial planning process with full engagement of key stakeholders, will provide the means to implement and integrate adaptation at the local level.  As local authorities review their development plans, they will now be required to integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation into these plans.  Local authorities should assess the extent to which existing development plans adequately address adaptation and where appropriate, aim to have a review process of their development plan underway by mid-2014 if climate adaptation is not adequately addressed.  On this basis, local development planning will, in effect, become the delivery mechanism for local climate adaptation action.</li>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
	Currently, some adaptation is occurring, albeit on a limited basis.  However, as the impacts of climate change are expected to increase with increasing global temperatures, the options for successful adaptation diminish and the associated costs increase with increasing climate change.  As a result, in order to best adapt to the consequences of current and future climate change, we must now begin to develop and implement strategies for adaptation.</p>
	
	<p>
	Until recently, adaptation planning was dominated by the 'science-first' or 'predict and provide' approach.  This approach is a linear cause-effect chain in which an assessment of future scenarios of climate change are used to estimate the future impacts of change, which then define adaptation needs.  However, these approaches placed a lot of faith in the ability of climate models to generate information that could be meaningfully employed in adaptation planning.  Moreover, in this approach, adaptation is seen largely as separate from social processes and activities and adaptation needs are largely determined by scientific analysis.  As a result of these shortcomings, a 'policy-first' approach is now considered most appropriate for planning for climate adaptation.  This approach considers current and future climate risk and recommendations for adaptation are determined not only by their potential to reduce current and future climate risk but also by their synergy with other policy objectives<span class="reference"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>   
	
	<p>In planning for adaptation to climate change, there are a wide range of frameworks and tools available.  For the most part, these tools are based on the adaptive management cycle and are based around a number of key steps and for each step, a number of associated tasks.  For the most part, these steps can be broadly described as follows:  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h3>1. Working in Partnership and Developing Objectives</h3>
	
	<p>The effects of Climate change will (and already do) affect different actors and sectors in different ways.  As a result, in order to plan for climate change adaptation, the active engagement of all relevant stakeholders in the adaptation process is of importance.  This engagement will allow all stakeholder views to be incorporated into the adaptation process.</p>
	
	<p>Before starting out, and in order to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation it is important to develop a set of objectives so that decisions, risks and options can be assessed according to their impact on a set of objectives.  These objectives/outcomes should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-oriented and Time-bound).  Importantly, adaptation objectives need not necessarily be specific to adaptation and using broader objectives can be helpful in mainstreaming adaptation into decision making.   
	
	<p>The process of forming objectives might begin with examining stakeholder concerns and an important outcome is to map what would be considered successful adaptation and translate these into quantifiable and measurable criteria to assess the effectives of adaptation options.</p>  
	
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right">
	<img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg">
	<figcaption>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the effects of a climate hazard. Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</figcaption></figure>
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right">
	<img src="/img/adaptation-scope-scale.jpg">
	<figcaption>Adaptation can occur through improving existing coping strategies, creating the capacity to adopt new ones, or by reducing exposure to known threats through making increasingly substantial, even transformational changes over longer time scales<span class="reference"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>.
	</figcaption>
	</figure> 
	
	
	
	<h3>2. Risk Assessment - Current and Future Climatic and non-Climatic Risk</h3>
	
	<p>As well as creating novel future problems to address, climate change is expected to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. As a result, gaining an understanding of your current vulnerability is important and will involve coming to a clear understanding of how climate currently affects you, both directly and indirectly.</p> 
	
	<p>In addition, an examination of current non-climatic pressures is also important as climate may indirectly alter how these pressures are manifest. In this respect, detailing these non-climatic pressures will provide useful insight into the sensitivities you must be aware of and also the adaptive capacities you have at your disposal in preparing for climate change.</p>
	
	<p>Once you have gained an understanding of your current vulnerability to climate change, you can begin to examine how a changing climate might affect you in the future. This stage involves 'horizon scanning' to identify where the system might be sensitive to future changes in climate and other factors, e.g. population growth.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3>3. Identifying and Characterising Adaptation Options</h3>
	
	<p>Based on the identified adaptation objectives and priority risks, and your assessment of current and future sensitivity, an inventory of  adaptation options should now be identified that are feasible (technically feasible and suitable to the case), appropriate (in line with meeting objectives and constraints) and effective in reducing current and future vulnerability. Identified adaptation options should then be characterised according to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Type: who is required to implement the option and does it require anticipatory action?</li>
	<li>Outcomes: What are the option’s costs and benefits and how do these change under different climate scenarios?  What impacts does the adaptation option cope with and how does it interact other adaptations, objectives and existing practises?;</li>
	<li>Temporal Characteristics: How do costs and benefits vary with time?  What is the lifetime of the measure, when can it be implemented and how long does it take? How flexible is the option? Can it be adjusted to account for new information in the future, does it entail sink costs?;</li>
	<li>Distributive Characteristics: How are the costs and benefits of a measure distributed? (who pays versus who benefits);</li>
	<li>Uncertainty:  Are there any risks associated with the adaptation option? Are the costs and benefits certain? Is there certainty about its ability to cope with the range of future climate change and in particular extremes?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>An important step in identifying adaptation options is separating potential low-regret options from those that are more sensitive to uncertainties around climate change and other drivers.  In most situations, a range of low-regret options are available and there are generally few cases of truly inflexible options where potentially high-regret decisions have to be made.</p>  
	
	<h3>4. Developing, Implementing and Managing an Adaptation Plan</h3>
	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/pathways.jpg"/> <figcaption>An adaptation pathways 'route map' details the range of options available to a decision maker once an adaptation measure fails to meet its objective, this point in time in termed an 'adaptation tipping point'.  Once an ATP is identified, a range of options are then identified to form an adaptation tree.</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>Once you have identified a range of adaptation options, an implementation plan can be detailed which will identify the range of measures to be implemented in the short (coping actions), and taking a flexible approach, in the medium (adjustment) and long term (transformation).  This flexibility is achieved by laying out an implementation plan that involves taking decisions overtime and adjusting to new circumstances, information or learning.</p>  
	
	<p>For example, the adaptation pathways approach details a route-map of possible adaptation options through time, starting with short term coping measures and once these fail to meet the objectives of the plan, a range of potential options are identified.</p> 
	 
	<p>Adaptation is an iterative process that needs to be closely monitored with regular review to ensure that it remains effective. Moreover, adaptation plans will need to be updated and refined over time as more information on impacts becomes available and experience of adaptation increase. This will ensure that the adaptation initiatives are working and will determine whether changes or refinements are required in response to new conditions and information.
