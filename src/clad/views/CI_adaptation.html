	<a name="Climate Adaptation"><h2>Climate Adaptation</h2>
	<p>
	Climate is changing and in order to meet the impacts and opportunities presented by these changes, adaptation is now required.  Due to our long history of greenhouse gas emission, even if levels of emission decrease, the persistence of these gases in the atmosphere and the slow warming of the oceans mean that temperatures and sea level will continue to rise for several decades.  As a result, regardless of our efforts to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas emission in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change, known as mitigating actions, adaptation actions are now essential.
	</p>
	<p>
	In their fourth Assessment Report, <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">the IPCC</a> (2007) defines adaptation as: "adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual 
	or expected climatic stimuli and their effects, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities".  The aim of adaptation is to reduce society's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change by anticipating changes in climatic conditions and the effects of these changes.  Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes (IPCC 2007).  
	
	<p>Vulnerabilty is thus a function of:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>exposure to climate hazard,</li>
	<li>senisitivity to climate hazard,</li>
	<li>capacity to adapt.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
		
	<a name="Why Adapt?"><h2>Why Adapt?</h2>
	<p>
	<center>
	<b>Irrespective of the level of mitigation, adaptation is necessary to avoid or reduce the negative impacts and to explore any 
	potential benefits of climate change <a href="http://www.ceps.eu/ceps/download/1495">(CEPS 2008)</a></b>
	</center>
	</p>
	<p>
	Climate change will have both direct and indirect effects on all aspects of Ireland's economy, society, and environment.  Human and natural systems will 
	adapt to climate change autonomously to some degree.  However, planned adaptation which involve decisions and measures within society to meet the adverse impacts 
	and opportunities presented by climate change is required.  Being prepared for these changes is important and these preparations help to reduce uncertainty and potential impacts of climate change by 
	identifying risks, options and starting the adaptation process.

	<a name="Adaptation Actions"><h2>Adaptation Actions</h2>
	<p>
	Adaptation actions aim to manage climate risk at an acceptable level and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.  Broadly, adaptation actions can be classified as:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Planned adaptation</b> involves action in advance of observed climate changes.  This might also be known as proactive adaptation.</li>
	<li><b>Reactive adaptation</b> involves action in respone/after weather phenomena has exposed ones vulnerability.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	Adaptation action can also be classified as <b>building adaptive capactity</b> and <b>delivering adaptive actions</b>.  
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Building adaptive capacity</b> involves activities that increase our capacity to adapt to climate change.  These activites include gathering the information required to understand your vulnerability to climate change (e.g.reliable information on the expected impacts of climate change, adaptive capacity, vulnerabilities, costs and benefits and adaptation options) and putting in place the supportive structures and governance required as a basis for the delivery of adaptation actions (e.g. awareness raising, obtaining senior management and community buy in and integrating climate risk and adaptation into planning and decision-making processes.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Delivering adaptive actions</b> refers to implementing actions that will help reduce climate risk and exploit opportunities.  These actions might include increasing water conservation measures or planting tree species which are known to have a broad range of tolerances.
	</p>
	
	<a name="How to Adapt?"><h2>How to Adapt?</h2>
	<p>
	Adaptation is an ongoing and iterative process and it is important to integrate adaptation response into planning and decision-making processes.  There are a number of key elements to the adaptation process and these are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Assessing your vulnerability to climate change</li>
	<li>Develop strategic objectives</li>
	<li>Identifying and assessing adaptation options</li>
	<li>Implementing adaptation opotions</li>
	<li>Monitoring and review</li>
	</ol>
	<p></p>
	<h3>1. Assessing your vulnerability to Climate Change</h3>
	<p>
	As a first step in the adaptation process, understanding your vulnerability to cliamte change is a good place to start.  This involves determining how your interests are affected by current climate trends and the occurence of extreme weather events.  This will help you to understand how future climate changes might affect you and will help you to identify your strategic objectives.  This assessment can be undertaken by assessing:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How have previous weather events affected your organisation and how well did you cope?</li>
	<li>Were critical thresholds exceeded that resulted in losses or opportunities?</li>
	<li>How is climate expected to change and what are the key impacts?</li>
	<li>Are there indirect impacts that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the priority risks?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>2. Develop Strategic Objectives</h3>
	<p>
	Strategic objectives should be developed that will address the priority risk and oppotunities identified in step 1.  Initally, a range of objectives should be identified.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3. Identifying adaptation options</h3>
	<p>
	After identifying a set of objectives, a wide range of adaptation measures should be identified and assessed.  On the basis of, amongst other, the relative costs of different adaptation options, a short list of viable adaptation options.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Adaptation options include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>No-regrets</b> options will deliver benefits that their costs whatever the extent of climate change, e.g. not building infrastructure in high-risk areas such as floodplains.</li>
	<li><b>Win-win</b> options will enhance your adaptive capacity while also helping to achieve other social, environmental or economic goals, e.g. improving teh cooling capacity of buildings through increased shading and.or less energy intensive cooling strategies. </li>
	<li><b>Flexible or adaptive management</b> options involves incremental adaptation options</li>
	<li></b>To delay a decision</b> to implement an adaptation measure is also a viable option when the time is used to find out more about the problem</li>
	<li><b>A decision to do nothing</b> may also represent a legtimate option in situation where climate risks are outweighed by other factors.  This decision, however, should not be used as a default poistion and should only be reached after caseful consideration of your climate risks and adaptation options.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Implementing adaptation options</h3>
	<p>
	Having considered risks (Step 1) and selecting preferred adaptation options.  An implementation plan needs to be developed that states what needs to be done, by whom and when, to convert adaptation options into actions.  The implementation of adaptation options will be contingent on the chosen adaptations and strongly linked to existing policies and procedures.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Monitoring and review</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation is an iterative process that needs to be closely monitored with regular review to ensure that it remains effective.  This step will ensure that the adaptation initiatives are working and to determine whether changes or refinements are required in response to new conditions and information.
