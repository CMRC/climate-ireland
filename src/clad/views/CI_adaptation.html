    <h2>Climate Adaptation</h2></a>
    
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Climate is changing and without taking appropriate actions to address the impacts and take advantage of opportunities presented by these changes, potentially disastrous consequences can be expected.  <a href="#mitigation-and-adaptation">Mitigation and adaptation</a> describe the various ways and techniques to tackle climate change.  Mitigation refers to ours efforts to tackle the causes of climate change while adaptation is about adjusting the way we do things to ensure that we are prepared for climate change.  Continuing mitigation efforts will reduce the need for adaptation. However, due to our long history of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation is now required.</p>

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	<img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg"/> <figcaption>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the effects of a climate hazard.  Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</figcaption></figure>
	
	<h4>Mitigation</h4>
	<p>
	Mitigation refers to actions that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving climate change; it includes reducing activities that give rise to emissions of greenhouse gases and enhance sinks for greenhouse gases in the forests and biosphere.  However, greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so even if we were to stop emitting them tomorrow, the climatic effects of these emissions would stay with us for the foreseeable future. To further compound the inevitability of climate change impacts, a long and slow process of warming of the Earth's oceans has been underway for many decades, a process that will ensure temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise throughout the century.  As a result, regardless of our efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation actions are now essential in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Adaptation</h4>
    <p>
    In their fourth Assessment Report, <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">the IPCC</a> (2007) defines adaptation as: "adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities".  Illustrating the flexibility with which its aims and objectives might be defined, adaptation has also been described as "the adjustment or preparation of natural or human systems to a new or changing environment, with the aim of moderating harm or exploiting beneficial opportunities" <span class="reference">[4]</span>. Therefore, the aim of adaptation is to reduce society's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change by anticipating changes in climatic conditions and the effects of these changes.  Moreover, adaptation means not only protecting against the negative impacts of climate change, but also building resilience and taking advantage of any opportunities/benefits that adaptation may bring.  Where adaptation efforts fall short, vulnerabilities are exacerbated.  In this context, the IPCC define vulnerability as "the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes" (IPCC 2007).

	<div id="adaptation-responses">
	<h3>Characterising Adaptation Responses</h3>
	<p>Adaptation options can be characterised in a number of ways; accoding to the driver that prompts adaptation, the decision making processes that lead to the implemntation of adaptation decisions, and the actions that are taken.</p>
	
	
	<a id="adaptation-driver">
	<div id="Adaptation-Driver">
	<h4>Adaptation Drivers</h4>
	
	<p>Adaptation can occur after the initial impact of climate change becomes evident, this is termed 'reactive adaptation', while adaptation that occurs before the impacts of climate change are obvious and is referred to as anticipatory or proactive adaptation.  Adaptation in natural systems is typically reactive, occurring in response to climatic stress.  For example, as a result of warming of the ocean in high latitudes, commercially valued fish species such as Mackeral have migrated north to Icelandic waters in large numbers <span class="reference">[?]</span>.  In contrast, adaptation in human systems can be both anticipatory and reactive.</p>
	
	<h4>Autonomous and Planned Adaptation</h4>
	<p>Autonomous adaptation is spontaneous response in natural or human systems to a variety of factors including climatic stimuli, socio-economic developments and market forces.  In human systems, autonomous adaptation is generally taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances to changing conditions.  To date many adaptation actions have been both autonomous and reactive.  These autonomous adjustments can be beneficial and can often take place without policy intervention.  However, autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal as there will be missed efficiency gains that would be gained from concerted actions.  Moreover, autonomous adaptation in one sector may have adverse effects on another sector, resulting in maladaptation, which occurs when an adaptation action results in an increase rather than a decrease in overall vulnerability to climate change impacts.</p>  
	
	<p>Planned adaptation aims to take measure to counter current or expected climatic impacts within the context of ongoing an expected societal change.  It is a deliberate decision taken due to an awareness that conditions have changed (reactive adaptation) or are about to change (anticipatory adaptation) and that action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state.  By anticipating and planning for climate change impacts, it is possible to reduce the costs and maximise the effectiveness of adaptation actions.  The type and scale of planned adaptation responses are determined both by the vulnerability of a given system to climate change impacts, and its inherent capability to adapt, or 'adaptive capacity'.  </p>
	
	 <a id="adaptation-actions">
	<h4>Adaptation actions</h4>
	
	<p>Undertaking adaptation involve two two key and interlinked actions, 'building adaptive capacity' and 'implementing adaptive options'.  'Adaptive capacity' refers to our ability to understand climate change, to evaluate its consequences for vulnerable communities, places, economies and ecosystems, to moderate potential damages and to take advantage of opportunities.  In order to deliver effective adaptation actions.  'Building adaptive capacity' is and essential step in the adaptation process and ensures that we have a robust knowledge base on which to deliver effective adaptation actions.  These activities include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Gathering the information required to understand the particular vulnerabilities to climate change a business, community or area might face;</li>
	<li>Providing the information, procedures, tools and supporting structures required as a basis for the delivery of adaptation actions.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>'Implementing adaptation responses' consists of implementing measures required to cope with existing or projected climate risk or to exploit opportunities presented by climate change. Adaptation responses can be grouped under three broad categories:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>'Grey' actions: technological and engineering solutions.  Examples include building or strengthening coastal defences;</li>
	<li>'Green' actions: ecosystem based approaches that use the multiple services of nature.</li>
	<li>'Soft' actions: mangerial, legal and policy approaches that alter human behaviour and style of governance.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>'Green' and 'Soft' actions aim to decrease the sensitivity of a system to climate impacts and increase the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems to build resilience to climate impacts.  In comparison to 'Grey' actions, 'Green' and 'Soft' actions are generally less resource intensive and provide multiple benefits.  In contrast, high-tech and innovative technological solutions, i.e. 'Grey Solutions', typically require high levels of funding, more research, and more ecperience and training to be implemented.</p>

	<p>Adaptive responses can be further characterised according to the extent to which they are justifiable under different climate change scenarios.  'Low regret' adaptation options are functional and providing benefits under a wide range of climate futures whereas 'High-regret' adaptation options are particualarly sensitive to choice of climate change scenario and would only make sense under a few climate change scenarios.  As a result, 'Low regret' options are of particular interest to policymakers and can be 'grey', 'green' or 'soft.</p>

      <h2>Why Adapt?</h2></a>
    
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
    
	<p>Irrespective of the level of mitigation we are able to enact,  climate change will have both direct and indirect effects on all aspects of Ireland's economy, society, and environment.  Adaptation is necessary to avoid or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and to explore any potential benefits that might be exploited.  As a result, regardless of uncertainties associated with future climate, a 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option.  Moreover, it has now been recognised that adaptation is an immediate need and there is now a clear policy mandate for adaptation to be incorporated into spatial planning practices in Ireland.</p>
    

	<figure style="float:right; clear:right"> 
	  <img src="/img/Ireland-snow.jpg"/> <figcaption>Ireland in the snow</figcaption></figure>
    
	
	<h3>A 'wait-and-see' approach is not an option</h3>
	
	<p>It is now clear that climate is changing and that these changes will continue and intensify in the future.  Although there are uncertainties about our knowledge of future climate, and the specific local impacts of climate change, a wait-and-see approach is not an option given the severity of the risks posed by climate change.
	</p>	
	<p>Human and natural systems will adapt to climate change autonomously to some degree.  However, planned adaptation which involves decisions and measures within society to respond to the adverse impacts and opportunities presented by climate change is essential if an unacceptable level of risk is to be avoided. Adaptation decisions, particularly those with long-term implications, need to be made now on the basis of the best available, albeit to some extent incomplete information.  This will involve drawing on approaches to strategy formulation that are both prudent and robust to uncertainty.  Being prepared for these changes is important and will help to reduce uncertainty, and the costs that climate change will pose.  We can act to limit the potential impacts of climate change by identifying risks, evaluating options and starting the adaptation process early enough to ensure that as many alternatives as possible remain available to us.  Moreover, well-planned, pro-active adaptation will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change and avoid incurring the worst of the considerable costs that climate change may impose in the absence of appropriate action.</p>
	
	<h3>Legislative requirement</h3>
	<p>Through the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, the Irish Government has recognised that climate adaptation is required to offset the worst consequences of climate change and take advantage of any opportunities that a changing climate might bring.  Moreover, the Irish Government recognises the importance of a strategic approach to climate change, and the critical importance of planning and development measures in delivering it.</p> 
	
	<p>The National Climate Change Adaptation Framework requires that adaptation plans are developed for the key sectors of the Irish economy and that local authorities take a proactive approach to climate change, integrating climate adaptation in the development of relevant policies, plans and programmes, and where necessary, retrospectively assessing plans recently enacted for the fitness of their handling of climate adaptation.</p>
	
	<p>Click <a href="/ci/adaptation/adaptation-policy" target="blank">here</a> for more information on the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework</p>
	
	<h3>Successful Adaptation</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently, a large evidence base on what constitutes good/successful adaptation is lacking.  Nevertheless, to avoid mal-adaptation, adaptation efforts should at minimum endeavour to avoid those pitfalls of adaptation which have already been identified, including:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Measures that increase greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
	<li>Measures that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable groups in society;</li>
	<li>Measures that come with high opportunity costs (social, economic and environmental) in comparison with alternatives;</li>
	<li>Measures that reduce the incentive for actors to adapt, e.g. by increasing the reliance of actors on others actions;</li>
	<li>Measures that create a path dependency, i.e. that adopt trajectories which are difficult to change in the future due to high costs involved in such change.</li>
	</ul>
	
   <p>Moreover, successful adaptation does not mean that the negative impacts of climate change will not occur, only that they will be less severe than had no adaptation taken place.  On this basis, 
    the goals of adaptation might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alleviating the current impacts of climate change;</li>
      <li>Reducing sensitivity and exposure to future climate change;</li>
      <li>Increasing the resilience to climate and non-climatic stressors;</li>
	  <li>Identifying opportunities to exploit any benefits that might accompany a changing climate.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div id="adaptation-actions">
  <a name="Adaptation Actions">
	<h2>Adaptation Types</h2></a>
	
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation aims to reduce climate vulnerability to an acceptable level and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.  Adaptation actions can be classified according to a number of criteria including:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>the driver/impetus that prompts adaptation action;</li> 
	<li>the approach to adaptation;</li>
	<li>the strategies or measures that are employed in commencing and implementing adaptation;</li> 
	</li> 
	
	<p>However, in practice, adaptation involves a mixture of measures and responses.</p>
	
	<a id="adaptation-driver">
	<div id="Adaptation-Driver">
	<h3>Adaptation Drivers</h3>
	
	<h4>Anticipatory and Reactive Adaptation</h4>
	<p>Depending on the timing, goal and motivation,implementation of adaptation can be either reactive or anticipatory.  Reactive adaptation occurs after the initial impact of climate change becomes evident, while anticipatory adaptation occurs before the impacts of climate change are obvious and is sometimes referred to as proactive adaptation.  Adaptation in natural systems is typically reactive, occurring in response to climatic stress.  For example, as a result of warming of teh ocean in high latitudes, commercially valued fish species such as Mackeral have migrated north to Icelandic waters in large numbers.  In contrast, adaptation in human systems can be both anticipatory and reactive.  Anticipatory adaptation might be implemented in order to cope with the projected impacts of climatic change.</p>
	
	<h4>Autonomous and Planned Adaptation</h4>
	<p>Autonomous adaptation is generally taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances.  These adaptations are often triggered by market or welfare changes that are induced by actual or anticipated climate change. To date many adaptation actions have been both autonomous and reactive.  For example, many adaptive actions can be taken by individuals, households and businesses to independently adjust their circumstances due to experiences or perceptions of climate risk.  These autonomous adjustments can be beneficial and can often take place without policy intervention.  However, autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal as there will be missed efficiency gains that would accrue from concerted actions.  Moreover, autonomous adaptation in one sector may have adverse effects on another sector, resulting in maladaptation, which occurs when an adaptation action results in an increase rather than a decrease in overall vulnerability to climate change impacts.  In addition, many adaptive actions have been reactive, for example, by taking place after an extreme weather event has occurred.</p>  
	
	<p>In contrast to autonomous adaptation, and given the increasing knowledge of climate change impacts, there is now an impetus to develop adaptation actions through proactive planning so that we are better placed to deal with future events.  By anticipating and planning for climate change impacts, it is possible to reduce the costs and maximise the effectiveness of adaptation actions.  The type and scale of planned adaptation responses are determined both by the vulnerability of a given system to climate change impacts, and its inherent capability to adapt, or 'adaptive capacity'.  Adaptation actions should aim to address climate change impacts and also increase 'adaptive capacity'. As a result, in order to plan effectively for adaptation, a number of building blocks need to be in place to aid a comprehensive and coherent national adaptation response:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><b>A robust knowledge base</b> - a clear understanding of expected exposure to climate change and the sensitivity of sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations and consequential potential impacts</li>
	<li><b>An assessment of adaptive capacity</b></li>
	<li><b>A vulnerability assessment</b></li>
	<li><b>Identification of adaptation requirements and the associated options, together with an estimation of costs and benefits</b></li>
	<li><b>An action plan</b></li>
	<li><b>A review mechanism</b></li>
	</ol>
	 
	 <a id="adaptation-approaches">
	<h3>Approaches to Adaptation<h3>
	 
	<h4>'Top-down' and 'Bottom-up' Approaches</h4>
	<p>Until recently, approaches to adaptation have been based on a standard impact-orientated, command and control (or 'top-down') approach.  This approach begins with simulated climate scenarios, generally downscaled to a regional basis, that are then applied to a specific target or unit, e.g. local area or watershed, through impact modelling.  Impacts on that unit are then estimated and on this basis, adaptation measures are then identified and evaluated.  While these studies have made significant contributions to the theoretical understanding of climate change, there are a number of criticisms to this approach and these include:</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>The scenarios employed are generally simplified versions of the locality under consideration</li>
	<li>The approach focuses on future climate.  As a result, it tries to address how uncertain impacts can be reduced by the process of adaptation unknown future socio-economic circumstances.</li>
	<li>The top-down approach often lacks sound damage estimates, which also fail to account for welfare effects or consideration of adaptive capacity.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In contrast to the 'top-down' approach, the 'bottom-up' approach to climate change is applied at the local scale, utilising a participatory approach.  The bottom-up approach first employs assessments of vulnerability to current climate variability and extremes, including an assessment of current adaptation strategies, policies and measures based on actual experience at different scales.  On this basis, the dimensions of new risks can the be assessed in the context of current knowledge and experience and can include information on broader changes (including demographic and socio-economic processes) as well as direct and indirect climate-related risks such as changing pests and diseases.</p>
	 
	 <a id="adaptation-actions">
	<h3>Adaptation Actions</h3>
	
	<h4>Building Adaptive Capacity</h4>
	
	<p>Adaptive capacity is the ability to understand climate change, to evaluate its consequences for vulnerable communities, places, economies and ecosystems, to moderate potential damages and to take advantage of opportunities.</p>  
	
	<p>In order to deliver responsive adaptation actions, building adaptive capacity is required and involves undertaking activities that increase our ability to adapt to climate change.  These activities include:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>gathering the information required to understand the particular vulnerabilities to climate change a business, community or area might face;</li>
	<li>providing the information, procedures, tools and supporting structures required as a basis for the delivery of adaptation actions.</li>
	
	<h4>Implementing Adaptive Actions</h4>
	<p>
	Implementing adaptive actions refers to implementing actions that will help reduce climate risk and exploit opportunities.  In adapting to the challenges of climate change, a number of strategies have been identified that are robust to uncertainty, including those that are: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Low regret</b>, being functional and providing benefits under a wide range of climate futures;</li>
	<li><b>Reversible</b>, in that costs are kept to a minimum in the case of assumptions regarding climate impact or adaptation response prove incorrect;</li>
	<li><b>Provide safety margins</b> which allow for climate change in the design or retrofitting of infrastructures;</li>
	<li><b>Soft</b>, thereby avoiding the need for expensive and typically irreversible engineering solutions and seek to institutionalise a long-term perspective in planning;</li>
	<li><b>Reduce the time horizons of investments</b>; and are</li>
	<li><b>Flexible</b> and <b>mindful of actions that are being taken by others</b> to either mitigate or adapt to climate change.</li>
	</ul>
	
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<div id="adaptation-uncertainty">
    <a name="Adaptation & Uncertainty">
	<h2>Adaptation & Uncertainty</h2></a>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>Adapting to the impacts of climate change is complex.  First, adaptation requires knowledge of future impacts and because of the inherent uncertainties in projecting future climate impacts, it can be difficult to choose the right or most appropriate adaptation measure.  Second, because adaptation problems do not occur in isolation, difficulties in predicting non-climatic factors such as social, demographic, political and economic change is also problematic.  Nonetheless, precise foresight of future change is not a key requirement for adaptation and these uncertainties do not prevent anticipatory adaptation.  A number of approaches are available to enable decision makers to manage uncertainty and they can be employed at a variety spatial scales, from individual decisions to sector-based and national adaptation planning.</p>
	
	<h3>Optimisation and Robustness</h3>
	
	<p>The goal of adaptation planning is to avoid mal-adaptation, a situation where additional costs are incurred or climate-related opportunities are not seized upon.  The uncertainties in projections mean that a decision-maker cannot predict with certainty how adaptation decisions made today will maximise future productivity or minimize costs.</p>

	<p>There are two approaches to cope with this situation:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>The first approach involves  making decisions that are robust to the uncertainties and will deliver benefits under any future scenario. In cases where there is low confidence in projections, this approach is suitable.
	

	
	<ul>
	<li>An adaptation option will be designed to perform adequetely across the full range of projected futures.  Examples include low-regret measures or a measure that is designed from the outset to cope with a range of climates.</li>  
	<li>Robust adaptation options buildin the option of flexiblity and can be adjusted if requried, for example, as new information comes to light or circumstances change.</li>  
	<li>A complemntary approach i sto build flexibiity into the decision-making process itself and adopt a wait-and-learn approach.  For example, sequencing adaptation options so that low-regret options are taken earlier and more inflexible options are delayed in anticipation of better information.</li>
	</ul>
	&nbsp

	<li>The second appraoch involves optimising a strategy based on the best available probabilities of different outcomes.  
	<ul>
	<li>Optimisation is a suitable strategy where flexibility will incur additional costs or trade-offs.  For example, building a flood wall with larger foundations to allow for future adaptation will incur a higher cost.</li>  
	<li>Similarly, delaying action in anticipation of new information might incur costs that are greater than the benefits of waiting.</li>
	
	</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Decision-making</h3>
	
	<p>The choice of  adaptation approach will be determined through the decision making process whereby trade-offs are examined.</p>
	
	<p>In their fourth assessment report, the IPCC identified a number of approaches to decision-making and these include:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Impact-based approaches:  the expected impacts of climate change are evaluated, resultant vulnerabilities and adaptation options are then identified.</li>
	<li>Adaptation and vulnerability based approaches: the processes effecting adaptive capacity and vulnerability, normally independent of any specific climate projection, are identified.  These approaches will generally identify adaptation options and measures that will increase the resillience or robustness of a system to climate changes and so have little sensitivities to climate shocks;</li>
	<li>Risk Management-Based Approaches: decision making if the focus and a framework for incorporating all approaches as well as confronting uncertainty is provided</li>

	<div id="adaptation-policy">
	<a name="Adaptation Policy">
	<h2>Adaptation Policy</h2>
	<p>Until recently, climate change policy has focused on actions to mitigate against climate change consequences though reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and enhancing sinks.  However, it is now recognised that adaptation is required to offset the detrimental impacts and take advantage of the opportunities presented by climatic change.  As a result, policy at both <a href="#policy-ireland">National</a> and <a href="#policy-europe">European</a> levels has begun to put in place frameworks to allow for planned adaptation to climate change.  This section provides an overview of these policies.</p>
	<a id="policy-eu">
	<h3>Adaptation Policy in the EU</h3></a>
	<p>The European Commission published a White Paper <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0147:FIN:EN:PDF" target="blank">"Adaptation to climate change: Towards a European framework for action"</a> in April 2009.  The paper calls for a more strategic approach to climate change adaptation to ensure that 'timely and effective adaptation measures are taken, ensuring coherency across different sectors and levels of governance'.  The overall aim of the strategy is to increase the climate resilience of a number of sectors which include health and social policies; biodiversity, ecosystems and water; coastal and marine; and production systems and physical infrastructures.  Moreover, a key area involves the role of the EU in addressing impacts of climate change that transcend the barriers of individual countries, e.g. river and sea basins.  The framework is based around a two-phase approach and recognises that close cooperation among stakeholders (EU, national, regional and local levels) will be required.  
	</p>
	<p>The first phase of the EU approach aims to lay the foundation for a comprehensive EU adaptation strategy to be implemented in the second phase.  The first phase has focused on the preparation of an overall EU framework for climate adaptation.  This has involved a number of key tasks which include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The collection of relevant information;</li>
	<li>The identification of climate change impacts for the EU;</li>
	<li>The mainstreaming of adaptation measures into key EU policies;</li>
	<li>The strengthening of international cooperation in the field of adaptation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This first phase culminated in the publication of an EU Adaptation Strategy  in 2013.  The focus now shifts to the second phase and the implementation of this strategy.  This will involve the mainstreaming of adaptation into key EU level policies, which include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP);</li>
	<li>Structural and Cohesion Funds;</li>
	<li>and Research.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<a id="policy-ireland"><h3>Adaptation Policy in Ireland</h3></a>
	
	<p><img src="/img/NAF-framework.svg" align="right" hspace="5px"/>Prior to the publication of <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/ClimateChange/FileDownLoad,32076,en.pdf" target="blank">Ireland's National Climate Change Adaptation Framework</a>, mitigation actions formed the impetus for climate change policy in Ireland.   However, the importance of adaptation was recognised in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad,1861,en.pdf"target="blank">Ireland's second National Climate Change Strategy (2007)</a>, and the principle of integrating adaptation into decision-making at national and local levels was established.</p>

	<p>In 2013, the need for adaptation was highlighted through the publication of Ireland's <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/ClimateChange/FileDownLoad,32076,en.pdf" target="blacnk">'National Climate Change Adaptation Framework'</a>, which draws together the work already done by government and the wider public sector on adaptation, with the objectives of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>providing the policy context for a strategic national adaptation response to climate;</li>
	<li>promoting dialogue and understanding of adaptation issues;</li>
	<li>identifying and promoting adaptation solutions;</li>
	<li>and committing actions to support the adaptation process.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Similar to the European framework, Ireland's national framework is a two step approach of which The National Adaptation Framework represents a first phase of a longer term process which will strengthen over time as the knowledge base evolves and the policy base matures.</p> 
	
	<p>Work in Phase 1 is now well underway and is focused on identifying national vulnerability to climate change, based on potential impacts relative to current adaptive capacity.  Reliable information on the range of socio-economic vulnerabilities, the adaptation options available and their associated costs and benefits in an Irish context, are key elements to inform effective adaptation planning.  While this process is by no means complete, it is now thought the there is sufficient information available to allow the process of adaptation planning to begin in parralel with the tasks required of phase 2.</p>  
	
	<p>The second phase involves the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation plans.  These will form a part of the comprehensive response to climate change.</p>  
	<ul>
	<li>Sectoral plans are to be prepared by the relevant department or agencies, and adopted by the relevant minister, with draft plans to be published by mid-2014 and, following approval should be reviewed at least every 5 years.</li>  
	<li>The spatial planning process with full engagement of key stakeholders, will provide the means to implement and integrate adaptation at the local level.  As local authorities review their development plans, they will now be required to integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation into these plans.  Local authorities should assess the extent to which existing development plans adequately address adaptation and where appropriate, aim to have a review process of their development plan underway by mid-2014 if climate adaptation is not adequately addressed.  Local development planning will, in effect, become the delivery mechanism for local climate adaptation action.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p><h3>Overview of Actions</h3></p>
	<p>The following is taken directly from Ireland's National Climate Change Adaptation Framework and provides an overview of actions for the five key areas identified through the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework.</p>
	
	<h4>Research and Knowledge Base</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to prioritise the filling of gaps in climate research needs and ensure that accessible information will continue to be provided to support the adaptation decision-making process. Other research work on adaptation in specific sectors is often carried out or commissioned by other Government Departments/bodies such as the OPW, Teagasc, Coford, etc. This research work will also continue to be supported and promoted by other relevant Departments.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support the EPA in continuing to play a lead role in building the evidence base and tools to help organisations adapt to climate change.</li>
	<li>To promote a more consistent approach to the dissemination of adaptation research and best practice, the EPA will continue to lead in the development of a web-based tool (to be known as the Climate Platform (CIP)) to help stakeholders plan their own decisions on adapting to climate change. The Climate Platform will include details of all EPA funded research on adaptation and the associated findings. Other State bodies will also provide specifics of their adaptation research for publication on the Platform.</li>
	<li>Future work under the EPA’s Climate Change Research Programme will take account of the need for adaptation indicators to assist in monitoring and reviewing of plans as well as allowing for comparison across plans.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support Met &Eacute;ireann in its development of climate prediction systems and provision of climate services for Ireland. Met Éireann will integrate its efforts with European and international initiatives within the overall co-ordination of the World Meteorological Organisation.</li>
	<li>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to support the development of enhanced national co-ordination of observation systems under the leadership of the EPA and Met Éireann who will, with the assistance of other responsible bodies and institutions, provide periodic updates on the state of Ireland’s climate system and provide analysis of data from this system.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Governance</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will lead and co-ordinate on international, EU and national climate adaptation policy, working as appropriate through the Cabinet Committee system. It will support and promote innovative policy-making on climate adaptation at all levels, and support strategic decision-making on how best to address the impacts of climate change.</li>
	<li>Individual Ministers will take responsibility for adaptation in their respective sector(s).</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community, and Local Government will support implementation of the Framework by local authorities.</li>
	<li>The City and County Managers’ Association (CCMA) will play an advisory role and facilitate the exchange of best practice in the implementation and development of climate adaptation policy at local level, fostering a shared approach to managing the impacts of climate change.</li>
	<li>In supporting local communities, local authorities must consider the issue of climate adaptation in the delivery of its services and infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Sectoral Plans</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Each relevant Government Department (or State Agency, where appropriate) will prepare adaptation plans for their sectors.</li>
	<li>Draft sectoral plans, based on sectoral risk assessments and following consultation with relevant stakeholders, to be published, by mid-2014 and adopted as quickly as possible thereafter.</li>
	<li>Sectoral adaptation plans should be revised and updated at least every 5 years. However, where sectoral mitigation plans are required under the proposed forthcoming primary legislation on climate change, both adaptation and mitigation plans should be prepared and reviewed in tandem to ensure full coherence of analysis and actions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Local Plans</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Local Authorities will take a proactive approach to climate change adaptation by integrating adaptation into the development of relevant policies, plans and programmes.</li>
	<li>As local authorities review their city and county development plans, they should integrate climate change adaptation (as well as mitigation) considerations into their statutory plans.</li>
	<li>Local authorities should aim to have the review process of their development plans underway by mid- 2014 (if necessary, through amendment and variation procedures) to include climate change adaptation if this is not already adequately addressed. As part of this process, local authorities will continue to collect evidence, raise awareness, and create the necessary relationships and actions needed to deliver purposeful adaptation measures.</li>
	<li>Once adopted, local plans will be reviewed thereafter in line with the cycle of development plan review under the planning and development legislative code.</li>
	<li>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will support and facilitate this approach through the preparation of guidelines for integrating climate adaptation into development plans as well as well as guidance on adaptation proofing of Strategic Environment Assessment</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Stakeholder Consultation</h4>
	<li>Government Departments and bodies will adopt an open, transparent, and inclusive approach to sectoral adaptation planning, with interested organisations and stakeholders being given early and adequate opportunity to input to the process of preparing adaptation plans.</li>
	<li>Public bodies will engage directly with others that are influenced by their policy decisions and embed adaptation as necessary into key areas of work such as investment in infrastructure, and the procurement of goods and services.</li>
	<li>Local authorities will continue to consult and encourage partnership with stakeholders when addressing adaptation matters at a local level, particularly through the open and participative process for making development plans, into which local adaptation planning is to be integrated.</li>
	<li>Each relevant Minister will foster a co-operative relationship with the private sector, and in particular the insurance sector, for the collection and dissemination of data on weather and catastrophe risk.</li>
	</ul>

	</figure>
	<p>
	Rather than a discrete project or event, adaptation is an ongoing and iterative process and needs to be considered in the context of broader organisational objectives.  It is therefore important to integrate adaptation into existing planning and decision-making processes.  The decision making framework described below is adapted from that described by Walker (2010) and is a 'policy-first' approach. Policy-first approaches typically begin at the scale of the adaptation problem (e.g. local area, sector) and adopt a 'tiered risk assessment', whereby instead of embarking on a highly detailed scientific assessment of the full range of possible impacts of climate change, a broad-brush risk assessment is undertaken beginning with with historic and current climate hazards, and then spiraling in to a more focussed assessment as and where required.

	<h2>A Framework for Planning for Climate Adaptation</h2>
			
	<p>The framework involves three key interdependent stages, each of which has a number of associated tasks.</p>  
	<ol class="small-indent">
	<li>The first stage of the analysis involves 'structuring the problem' and involves the identification of adaptation objectives, the undertaking of a preliminary risk assessment and an examination of available adaptation options.  By the end of this stage, a clearer picture of the adaptation issues to address will have been realised.</li>  
	<li>The second stage, 'appraise solutions', aims to undertake a more specific qualitative/quantitative assessment in order to facilitate a structured and informed selection between adaptation options, and the coherent sequencing of option implementation through time.  There may be cases where this second stage of analysis will not be required, particularly where low-regret adaptation options have been identified.</li>  
	<li>The third stage of the process involves the implementation of the selected adaptation options and subsequent monitoring and review of their effectiveness.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>1.	Structure the Problem</h2>
	<h3>1.1 Define relevant objective and constraints</h3>
	<p>As in any key decision context, a crucial first step to take in adaptation decision-making is the identification of relevant objectives and constraints.  This is in order to ensure that the risks and options identified later in the analysis are examined in the context of their impact on a pre-defined set of objectives and constraints. Relevant objectives need not however be adaptation specific, employing broader objectives can be useful in mainstreaming adaptation into the decision making process.  It is also important that all relevant constraints on action are identified, these include economic political, geographical and environmental constraints.</p>
	
	<p>As a changing climate will affect a wide range of actors at sectoral, local, regional and national levels, the processes of identifying adaptation objectives and coming to adaptation decisions should provide the scope for all interested individuals and organisations to make a meaningful contribution.  The setting and prioritising of objectives will not be a simple process, particularly where a large number of stakeholders are involved, as there are a number of difficult and often complex trade-offs to be made  between management objectives and the means by which they might be achieved.

	<h3>1.2 Assessment of vulnerability</h3>
	<p>
	Climate change presents different challenges for individual sectors, areas, ecosystems and populations. As a result,  an understanding of your expected climate change exposure, and the sensitivity of your sector, area, ecosystem, population, and therefore consequential potential impacts is a fundamental starting point.  
	</p>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:left">
	<img src="/img/Vulnerability.jpg">
	<figcaption>The potential impact of climate change reflects the likelihood of exposure to a climate hazard in combination with the sensitivity to the effects of a climate hazard. Vulnerability is a function of the potential impact of a climate hazard and also the capacity to adapt to the potential impact</figcaption></figure>
	
	<h4>1.2.1 Current vulnerability</h4> 

	<p>As well as creating novel future problems to address, climate change is expected to exacerbate the existing vulnerabilities of most sectors and regions. As a result, understanding your current vulnerability is important and will help you understand your levels of adaptive capacity, future susceptibility to changing weather patterns, and also to identify low-regret adaptation options.</p>
	
	<p>Identifying existing vulnerability will involve coming to a clear understanding of how climate currently affects you, both directly and indirectly. In addition, an examination of current non-climatic pressures is also important as climate may indirectly alter how these pressures are manifest. In this respect, detailing these non-climatic pressures will provide useful insight into the sensitivities you must be cognisant of, and the adaptive capacities you have at your disposal in preparing for climate change.</p>
	
	<p>In understanding your current vulnerability, key questions might include:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>How have previous weather events affected your organisation or community?</li>
	<li>Were critical thresholds exceeded that resulted in losses or opportunities?</li>
	<li>How well did you cope?</li>
	<li>Were there any indirect impacts that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the key non-climatic pressures your organisation or community currently faces?</li>

	<h4>1.2.2 Future vulnerability</h4> 
	<p>Once you have gained an understanding of your current vulnerability to climate change, you can begin to examine how a changing climate might affect you in the future.  This stage involves 'horizon scanning' to identify where the system might be sensitive to future changes in climate and other factors, e.g. population growth.  This examination will involve obtaining high level (i.e. non-detailed) information about the scale of the potential future change and combining this with an understanding of current and historical vulnerability to understand how you might be impacted in the future. This exploration should provide you with a clear understanding of how the range of potential consequences of climate change might affect your organisation, sector or local area.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How is climate expected to change and what are the key impacts of these changes?</li>
	<li>Are there indirect impacts that need to be considered?</li>
	<li>What are the priority risks?</li>
	<li>How will the non-climatic pressures you face change and evolve in the future?</li>
	<li>Will these changes increase the sensitivity of your sector or community to climate change or enhance its capacity to adapt?</li>
	
	<strong>Outputs</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>A list of identified current vulnerabilities and future sensitivities</li>

	<h3>1.3 Development of Adaptation Options</h3>
	<p>
	Adaptation can occur through improving existing coping strategies, creating the capacity to adopt new ones, or by reducing exposure to known threats through making increasingly substantial, even transformational changes over longer time scales. 
	</p>
	
	<figure style="float:right; clear:left">
	<img src="/img/adaptation-scope-scale.jpg" class="big">
	<figcaption>
	</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>Based on the identified ‘adaptation objectives’ and ‘priority risks’, and your assessment of current and future sensitivity, an inventory of  adaptation options should now be identified that are feasible (technically feasible and suitable to the case), appropriate (in line with meeting objectives and constraints) and effective in reducing current and future vulnerability. Identified adaptation options should then be characterised according to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Type: who is required to implement the option and does it require anticipatory action?</li>
	<li>Outcomes: What are the option’s costs and benefits and how do these change under different climate scenarios?  What impacts does the adaptation option cope with and how does it interact other adaptations, objectives and existing practices?</li>
	<li>Temporal Characteristics: How do costs and benefits vary with time?  What is the lifetime of the measure, when can it be implemented and how long does it take? How flexible is the option? Can it be adjusted to account for new information in the future, does it entail sink costs?</li>
	<li>Distributive Characteristics: How are the costs and benefits of a measure distributed? (who pays versus who benefits)</li>
	<li>Uncertainty:  Are there any risks associated with the adaptation option? Are the costs and benefits certain? Is there certainty about its ability to cope with the range of future climate change and in particular extremes?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>An important step in identifying adaptation options is separating potential low-regret options from those that are more sensitive to uncertainties around climate change and other drivers.  In most situations, a range of low-regret options are available and there are generally few cases of truly inflexible options where potentially high-regret decisions have to be made.</p>  

	<strong>Outputs:</strong> 
	<ul>
	<li>An inventory of characterised adaptation options</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>2.	Appraise Solutions</h2>

	<p>Following completion of the first stage of the analysis, a more complete picture of the nature of the adaptation problem should have begun to coalesce; the objectives and constraints, the key drivers of risk today and the future, the key sensitivities of the system to be adapted and the range of feasible and potentially desirable adaptation options.  The second part of the analysis involves a more specific assessment (qualitative or quantitative) to help the you choose between different adaptation options and the sequencing of adaptation options over time. However, the second stage is not necessary in all cases or could be conducted at a generic level rather than a detailed quantitative level. For example, if the first stage of the analysis identified clear solutions then additional analysis may not be required.  This will most likely be the case where the decision maker is working with well-defined single objectives, the number of options is small and options are low/no regret.  Where there are significant potential trade-offs between different objectives and decision criteria a detailed quantitative assessment of individual adaptation options may be required.  For example, these type of decisions are generally involved in planning long-term infrastructure projects with high sunk costs.  An important consideration  at the beginning of the appraise solutions stage is to decide where additional analysis can improve the decision.</p>
	
	<h3>2.1 Assess individual adaptation options</h3>

	<p>In order to assess individual adaptations , a set of metrics needs to be produced/computed that allows for ranking and comparison of the adaptation options.  The metrics computed should be linked with the adaptation objectives and will be employed in the following stage of the analysis.  For example, where economic criteria are of concern, individual adaptation options should be ranked according to their costs and benefits through time and under a range of climate change scenarios.  In other cases, metrics might account for environmental concerns, e.g. where water quality is of concern.</p>  

	<strong>Outputs:</strong> 
	<ul>
	<li>a set of measures that characterise the performance of the adaptation option.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>2.2 Decision analysis to generate implementation plans</h3>
	
	<p>In this next step, decision methods are employed to grade the effectiveness of options in the context of the combined objectives of adaptation and also considering uncertainty.  From this, a plan can be generated to implement one or several best options and specify what should be implemented, where and when.</p>
	
	<p>Inputs to decision analysis generally include information about the risks and opportunities and options available and generates rules for action.  Taking the metrics produced in the previous step, adaptation options will be ranked according to a chosen decision method.  As differing adaptation options have differing lifetimes and effectiveness, the output of the decision analysis should be a set of conditional implementation rules, i.e if X occurs by date Y, then do Z.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Utility/Expected Value Analysis may be appropriate if the probabilities of expected changes are know and unlikely to change with new information.</li>
	<li>Real Options Analysis might be appropriate if the probabilities are considered trustworthy based on current sets of knowledge but are likely to be refined overtime as new information is produced.</li>
	<li>Maximum Expected Utility Analysis might be appropriate if the confidence in projections is lower, e.g. conflicting probabilities from different models or incomplete probability estimates.</li>
	<li>Robust Decision Theory might be most appropriate where there is no confidence in the projections.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<strong>Output:</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>An implementation Plan</li>
	

	<h3>3.	Implement Plan</h3>
	<p>The implementation of adaptation options will be contingent on the chosen adaptations and being strongly linked to existing policies and procedures.</p>  
	<p>In Ireland, mainstreaming of adaptation into existing policies and procedures is to be principally achieved through:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Spatial Planning - At a local level, adaptation is to be incorporated into development (City and County) and local area plans. The changing climate will present different challenges to each local authority based on their vulnerability to climate risk and their capacity to adapt. As a result, preparation for expected impacts and integrating appropriate responses into the development of policies, plans and programmes is required. As a first step, existing development and local area plans are to be reviewed to include climate change adaptation (if necessary through amendment and variation procedures) if this is not already adequately addressed. This review process is to be underway by mid-2014. In effect, development plans will become the mechanism for the delivery of local adaptation action.</li>
	<li>Sectoral Planning - At a sectoral level, adaptation is to be incorporated into sectoral plans developed by relevant Government Department or State Agency. Draft sectoral plans are to be published by mid-2014 and will be based on sectoral risk assessments.</li>
	<li>SEA Procedures - In line with European Directives and national policy, the conduct of SEA in Ireland will involve greater emphasis on the role of climate adaptation. As knowledge accrues with respect to the efficacy and indirect effects of adaptation initiatives, scoping and cumulative impacts assessment processes will incorporate analyses of how adaptation objectives will be met in assessing the credentials of a given plan, policy or programme.</li>

	<h3>4. Evaluate, monitor and review</h3>

	<p>Adaptation is an iterative process that needs to be closely monitored with regular review to ensure that it remains effective. Moreover, adaptation plans will need to be updated and refined over time as more information on impacts becomes available and experience of adaptation increase. This step will ensure that the adaptation initiatives are working and will determine whether changes or refinements are required in response to new conditions and information.
